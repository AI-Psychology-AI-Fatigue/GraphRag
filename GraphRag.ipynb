But this car-diovascular/anaerobic model is unsatisfactory because (i)a more rigorous analysis indicates that the ﬁrst organ tobe affected by anaerobiosis during maximal exercisewould likely be the heart, not the skeletal muscles. Thisprobability was fully appreciated by the pioneering exer-cise physiologists, A. V . Hill, A. Bock and D. B.

This information is readily available andis likely to be well known to most exercise scientists(Saltin & Gollnick 1983, Holloszy & Coyle 1984).Similarly there is an extensive literature on the cellu-lar mechanisms believed to cause the fatigue that de-velops during exercise (Fitts 1994).\\nIn contrast, fewer studies have evaluated the extent\\nto which these adaptations explain the improvements\\n* Based on Keynote addresses presented at the Fourth IOC\\nW orld Congress on Sports Sciences, Monte-Carlo, Monaco,October 22–26, 1997 and the IV Scandinavian Congress onMedicine and Science in Sports, Lahti, Finland, 5–8 Novem-ber 1998.\\n123there is full activation of the total skeletal muscle mass,\\nand (iv) cardiovascular and other measures believed to re-late to skeletal muscle anaerobiosis, including the maxi-mum oxygen consumption (VO\\n2max) and the ‘‘anaerobic\\nthreshold’’, are indifferent predictors of exercise capacityin athletes with similar abilities. This review considers fouradditional models that need to be considered when factorslimiting either short duration, maximal or prolonged sub-maximal exercise are evaluated. These additional modelsare: (i) the energy supply/energy depletion model; (ii) themuscle power/muscle recruitment model; (iii) the bio-mechanical model and (iv) the psychological model. Byreviewing features of these models, this review provides abroad overview of the physiological, metabolic and bio-mechanical factors that may limit exercise performanceunder different exercise conditions. A more completeunderstanding of fatigue during exercise, and the relevanceof the adaptations that develop with training, requires thatthe potential relevance of each model to fatigue under dif-ferent conditions of exercise must be considered.\\nin performance that occur with different types of\\nphysical training (Acevedo & Goldfarb 1989, Danielset al. 1978, Hawley et al. 1997, Houston et al. 1979,Moore et al. 1997, Ramsbottom et al. 1989,W estgarth-Taylor et al. 1997, W eston et al. 1997) andwhich presumably result from changes that delay theonset or development of fatigue. There are at leastthree probable reasons for this.\\nFirst, many exercise physiologists may consider\\nthis to be the work of the coach, not of the scientist.Or, accustomed to the tightly controlled conditionsof laboratory research, some scientists may be reluc-tant to undertake ﬁeld-based studies of performancein which all the different variables inﬂuencing humanperformance are not easily controlled. Human per-formance is inﬂuenced by many variables, not leastthose involving the psyche. Many scientists may feel,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Noakes\\nperhaps justiﬁably, that these variables cannot be suf-\\nﬁciently well controlled in ﬁeld studies for there to bemeaningful ﬁndings.\\nSecond, there is a dearth of tools to measure accu-\\nrately human performance in the laboratory. If sportsperformance cannot be measured frequently with ahigh degree of precision in the laboratory, then train-ing-induced changes in exercise performance are notquantiﬁable. As a result, most studies use physiologi-cal surrogates to predict changes in exercise perform-ance. The most widely used performance surrogate isthe maximum oxygen consumption (VO\\n2max). But,\\nthe very use of this speciﬁc measure has helped toentrench a particular and, perhaps, unquestioningdogma of the factors that likely determine human ex-ercise performance (Noakes 1988, 1997, 1998).\\nAs a result, most of the training studies reported\\nin the literature have measured the physiological andbiochemical responses of the human to training andhave paid less attention (i) to the extent to which hu-man exercise performance is altered by differenttraining programmes and (ii) to the speciﬁc physio-logical adaptations which explain training-inducedchanges in athletic performance.\\nIndeed, an important weakness in our current\\nthinking in exercise physiology is that we lack certainknowledge of the precise factors that determine fa-tigue and hence limit performance in different typesof exercise under a range of environmental con-ditions. In part, this is because some scientists remainunaware that their research is based on the (subcon-scious) acceptance usually of one speciﬁc model ofhuman exercise physiology (Noakes 1997, 1998). Butit would be very surprising if one single physiologicalmodel adequately explains human exercise perform-ance under all conditions.\\nAccordingly, the aim of this review is not to de-\\nscribe how the body adapts to physical training. Thisinformation is freely available, largely descriptive andnot particularly contentious, so that its review is un-likely to challenge how we think about our science.Rather I will use this opportunity to pose two ques-tions: What physiological models have exercise scien-tists developed (and subconsciously accepted) for thestudy of the physiological and biochemical determi-nants of fatigue during exercise? And which speciﬁcphysiological, metabolic or biomechanical attributes\\nTable 1. Current physiological models to understand the physiology of\\ntraining for enhanced endurance performance\\n(a) The cardiovascular/anaerobic model(b) The energy supply/energy depletion model(c) The muscle recruitment (central fatigue)/muscle power model(d) The biomechanical model(e) The psychological/motivational model\\n124might explain superior athletic performance and en-\\nhanced resistance to the development of fatigue?\\nCurrent physiological models to understand the\\nphysiology of training for enhanced enduranceperformance\\nTable 1 lists ﬁve different models that are commonly\\nused to study and explain the likely physiological andother training-induced changes that may improve,especially, endurance performance, probably by de-laying or preventing the onset of fatigue. Each modelhas its own proponents, usually those with a specialexpertise in the speciﬁc areas embraced by the model.Thus, the cardiovascular/anaerobic model is pro-moted usually by cardiovascular and respiratoryphysiologists; the energy supply/energy depletionmodel is favoured by the exercise biochemists; themuscle power/muscle recruitment model is advocatedby muscle physiologists, and some biomechanists andneuro-physiologists; the biomechanical model by bio-mechanists, and the psychological/motivationalmodel by sports psychologists.\\nY et it is highly improbable that the factors explain-\\ning human exercise performance under all conditionsare restricted to one physiological system or to onescientiﬁc discipline. Thus, human performance is un-likely to be adequately deﬁned by any of these uni-tary models that are often presented as if they aremutually exclusive. The complexity of the physiologi-cal and other factors determining human perform-ance is emphasized when the limitations of each ofthese models are exposed.\\nThe cardiovascular/anaerobic model\\nMaximal exercise\\nThis model holds that endurance performance is de-termined by the capacity of the athlete’s large heartto pump unusually large volumes of blood and oxy-gen to the muscles. This allows the muscles to achievehigher work rates before they outstrip the availableoxygen supply, developing skeletal muscle anaerobi-osis (Fig. 1) (Noakes 1988, 1997, 1998, Bassett &Howley 1997). This model remains the most popularfor explaining why fatigue develops during exercise;how the body adapts to training; how these adap-tations enhance performance and, as a consequence,how effective exercise training programmes should bestructured.\\nThis model predicts that training increases ‘‘cardio-\\nvascular ﬁtness’’ especially by increasing the body’smaximum capacity to consume oxygen, measured asthe maximum oxygen consumption (VO\\n2max). This\\neffect results from an increased maximum capacity ofthe heart to pump blood (the cardiac output) andan enhanced capacity of the muscles to consume that'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nFig. 1. The Cardiovascular/Anaerobic Model of Exercise Physi-\\nology and Athletic Performance holds that the heart has a limit-ing maximum cardiac output that is reached at the onset of a‘‘plateau phenomenon’’, ascribed incorrectly to the work of Hilland colleagues (Hill et al. 1924, Hill 1927). As a result, bloodand hence oxygen ﬂow to the exercising muscles falls behinddemand, inducing anaerobic metabolism. Metabolites of anaer-obic metabolism, in particular hydrogen ions, then inhibitmuscle contraction, inducing fatigue.\\noxygen, the latter by increasing skeletal muscle capil-\\nlarization and mitochondrial mass. It is argued thatthese adaptations delay the onset of skeletal muscleanaerobiosis during vigorous exercise, thereby reduc-ing blood lactate concentrations in muscle and bloodat all exercise intensities above the so-called ‘‘anaer-obic threshold’’. The delayed onset of this blood lac-tate accumulation then allows the exercising musclesto continue contracting for longer at higher intensit-ies before the onset of fatigue.\\nIn addition, these changes increase the capacity of\\nthe muscles to use fat as a fuel during exercise, there-by enhancing endurance performance (according tothe Energy Depletion model, described subsequently)(Saltin & Gollnick 1983, Holloszy & Coyle 1984). Animportant but unrecognized prediction of this modelis that increases in coronary blood ﬂow must be anessential adaptation to training (Noakes 1998). Thehigher coronary blood ﬂow allows a greater pumpingcapacity of the heart producing a greater cardiac out-put to perfuse the exercising muscles, which can thenachieve a higher exercise capacity.\\nThis model ﬁnds strong support from the conﬁr-\\nmation that these changes, with the exception of agreater coronary ﬂow which is inferred, not proven,do indeed result from training, as fully documentedin the literature. The key question is whether thesechanges are causally linked; that is, do these changescause the change in exercise performance or do theyoccur pari-passu with other adaptation(s) that are thereal cause of changes in exercise performance. Forthere are important deﬁciencies in this model whichare fully argued (Noakes 1988, 1997) and counter-argued (Noakes 1998, Bassett & Howley 1997) else-where and will not be repeated here.\\n125Perhaps the major but overlooked limitation of this\\nmodel is that, if the pumping capacity of the heartdoes indeed limit oxygen utilization by the exercisingskeletal muscle, then the heart itself will be the ﬁrstorgan affected by any postulated oxygen deﬁciency(Noakes 1998). This was ﬁrst recognized by Hill andhis colleagues as early as 1925 (Hill et al. 1924). Para-doxically it was the incorrect interpretation, byothers, of the work of Hill and his colleagues, in par-ticular their supposed description of a plateau phe-nomenon (Noakes 1998), that forms the (mythical)foundation for the cardiovascular/anaerobic model ofexercise physiology. Y et those who popularized thismythical interpretation of the work of Hill and hiscolleagues, failed also to record what Hill consideredto be the physiological cause (and equally the conse-quence) of the fatigue that develops during maximalexercise.\\nFor the interpretation of Hill and his colleagues\\nwas unequivocal: ‘‘Certain it is that the capacity ofthe body for muscular exercise depends largely, if notmainly, on the capacity and output of the heart. Itwould obviously be very dangerous for the organ tobe able, as the skeletal muscle is able, to exhaust itselfvery completely and rapidly, to take exercise far inexcess of its capacity for recovery ... When the oxygensupply becomes inadequate, it is probable that the\\nFig. 2. The weakness of the Cardiovascular/Anaerobic Model\\nof Exercise Physiology and Athletic Performance is that the at-tainment of a maximum cardiac output has more serious conse-quences for the heart than it does for the skeletal muscles asthe ﬁrst organ to be affected by a maximum cardiac outputwould be the heart itself. Continuing to exercise with a ﬁxed(maximum) cardiac output would cause myocardial ischaemia.The heart, unable to increase coronary ﬂow (dependant on anincrease in cardiac output), would be unable to balance the in-creased myocardial oxygen demand caused by the very increasein workrate, theoretically necessary to deﬁne the mythical ‘‘pla-teau phenomenon’’ of Hill and his colleagues. Many early re-searchers believed that the heart did indeed develop ischaemiaduring maximal exercise, leading to a fall in cardiac output (Hillet al. 1924, Bainbridge 1931, Hill 1927, Dill 1938).'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Noakes\\nheart rapidly begins to diminish its output, so avoid-\\ning exhaustion ... ’’.\\nThe point identiﬁed by Hill and his colleagues, and\\nsince ignored by all subsequent generations of exer-cise physiologists, is that the heart is also a muscle,dependent for its function on an adequate blood andoxygen supply. But, unlike skeletal muscle, the heartis dependent for its blood supply on its own pumpingcapacity. Hence any intervention that reduces thepumping capacity of the heart, or demands the heartsomehow to sustain an increased work output by theexercising muscles without any increase in cardiacoutput and coronary ﬂow (as theoretically occurswhen the ‘‘plateau phenomenon’’ develops), imperilsthe heart’s own blood supply. Any reduction in coro-nary blood ﬂow will consequently reduce the heart’spumping capacity, thereby inducing a vicious cycle ofprogressive and irreversible myocardial ischaemia(Fig. 2). It would seem logical that human designshould include controls to protect the heart from everentering this vicious circle.\\nHence if (skeletal) muscle function fails when its\\noxygen demand exceeds supply then, for logical con-sistency, the inability of the pumping capacity of theheart to ‘‘raise the cardiac output’’ at the VO\\n2max\\n(Rowell 1993), must also result from an inadequate(myocardial) oxygen supply caused by a plateau in\\nFig. 3. According to the logic of the Cardiovascular/Anaerobic\\nModel of Exercise Physiology and Athletic Performance, coro-nary ﬂow must be the ﬁrst physiological variable to ‘‘plateau’’during progressive exercise to exhaustion. The peak in coronaryﬂow would then induce a plateau in cardiac output as a resultof a progressive myocardial ischaemia. Continuing to exercisewith a ﬁxed cardiac output and coronary ﬂow would rapidlycause an ischaemia-induced fall in cardiac output and in coro-nary ﬂow, and hence in whole body oxygen consumption. Thislogic was accepted by the early proponents of this model (Hillet al. 1924, Bainbridge 1931, Hill 1927, Dill 1938) but has sincebeen overlooked by exercise physiologists for the past 75 years.\\n126coronary ﬂow. This limiting coronary blood ﬂow in-\\nduces myocardial ‘‘fatigue’’, causing the plateau incardiac output and hence in the VO\\n2max leading,\\nﬁnally, to skeletal muscle anaerobiosis. Thus, by thislogic, the coronary blood ﬂow must be the ﬁrstphysiological function to show a ‘‘plateau phenom-enon’’ during progressive exercise to exhaustion (Fig.3). All subsequent physiological ‘‘plateaus’’ must re-sult from this limiting coronary ﬂow (Noakes 1998).\\nWhereas the most inﬂuential modern exercise\\nphysiologists have enthusiastically embraced thismythical basis for a ‘‘plateau phenomenon’’ for thepast 75 years, none seems to have grasped this logicalprediction of the ‘‘plateau phenomenon’’, which isthat the ‘‘plateau phenomenon’’ requires the heart tofatigue ﬁrst before skeletal muscle fatigue can de-velop. But this was clearly a concept with which thepioneering exercise physiologists were entirelycomfortable. Thus, in addition to the conclusion ofHill and his colleagues, already quoted, both Bockand Dill (Bainbridge 1931) also believed that myocar-dial hypoxia causes a fall in the cardiac output at thepoint of fatigue during high intensity exercise:\\n‘‘The blood supply to the heart, in many men, may\\nbe the weak link in the chain of circulatory adjust-ments during muscular exercise, and as the intensityof muscular exertion increases, a point is probablyreached in most individuals at which the supply ofoxygen to the heart falls short of its demands, andthe continued performance of work becomes difﬁcultor impossible’’ (p. 15). Hence they proposed that:‘‘Another factor, which may contribute to the pro-duction of this type of fatigue, is fatigue of the heartitself ’’ (p. 229).\\n‘‘Although the occurrence of fatigue of the heart\\nin health is not very clearly established, a temporarylowering of the functional capacity of the heart, in-duced by fatigue of its muscular ﬁbres, might gradu-ally bring about during exercise an insufﬁcient bloodsupply to the skeletal muscles and brain. The lassi-tude and disinclination for exertion, often experi-enced on the day after a strenuous bout of exercise,has been ascribed to fatigue of the heart as its pri-mary cause’’ (p. 229). Hence they concluded: ‘‘Theheart, as a rule, reaches the limit of its powers earlierthan the skeletal muscles, and determines a man’scapability for exertion’’.\\nIn summary, the early physiologists who believed\\nthat skeletal muscle anaerobiosis limits maximal exer-cise clearly understood that any plateau in cardiacoutput, necessary for there to be a limiting skeletalmuscle blood ﬂow, must result from a plateau in coro-nary blood ﬂow which would expose the heart to aprogressive myocardial ischaemia that would worsenas exercise was prolonged.\\nPerhaps the reluctance of modern physiologists to\\nacknowledge these concepts stems from the current'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nappreciation that progressive myocardial ischaemia\\ndoes not occur during maximal exercise in healthyathletes (Raskoff et al. 1976), even though there isgood evidence that it is a limiting cardiac output thatprobably determines the VO\\n2max (Rowell 1993).\\nThus, one postulate might be that even if cardiac out-put limits maximal exercise as seems likely (Noakes1997), termination of exercise must occur before theheart actually reaches that maximum and hence wellbefore skeletal muscle anaerobiosis can develop(Noakes 1998). Hence for 75 years, exercise physiol-ogists may have focused on the incorrect organ as thesite of any potential anaerobiosis that may developduring maximal exercise (Hill et al. 1924, Bainbridge1931, Hill 1927, Hill et al. 1924).\\nHow might a maximal cardiac output be reached\\nwithout the development of myocardial ischaemia?The argument that the rate of cardiac ﬁlling, dueeither to a limiting venous return or the effects of arestrictive pericardium (Stray-Gundersen et al. 1986)may limit the maximal cardiac output, whilst super-ﬁcially attractive, is still unable satisfactorily to ex-plain which physiological events terminates exercise.Such an argument fails for the reason that the con-tinuation of exercise beyond that (however limited)maximal cardiac output must still cause a progressivemyocardial ischaemia to develop (Fig. 2). Hence, evenif the cardiac output is limited by factors unrelatedto the development of myocardial ischaemia (for ex-ample, a limiting venous return), the continuation ofexercise beyond that point of limitation must inducemyocardial ischaemia and the development of chestpain (angina pectoris) that would terminate exercise.\\nPerhaps it is more logical to speculate that maxi-\\nmal exercise terminates as part of a regulated processbefore the absolute maximum cardiac output andcoronary blood ﬂow are achieved. Interestingly Hilland his colleagues seem to have been the ﬁrst to sug-gest a solution to this dilemma as early as 1924:‘‘From the point of view of a well co-ordinated mech-anism, ... it would clearly be useless for the heart tomake an excessive effort if by doing so it merely pro-duced a far lower degree of saturation of the arterialblood; and we suggest that, in the body (either in theheart muscle itself or in the nervous system), there issome mechanism which causes a slowing of the circu-lation as soon as a serious degree of unsaturation oc-curs, and vice versa. This mechanism would tend toact as a governor maintaining a high degree of satu-ration of the blood’’ (Hill et al. 1924, p. 161–162).\\nClearly no such governor has yet been discovered,\\nperhaps because no physiologists have yet searchedfor it. But there is clear physiological evidence for theexistence of such a governor. The evidence comesfrom studies of skeletal and cardiac muscle functionat altitude. For if oxygen deﬁciency really does de-velop in either heart or skeletal muscle during maxi-\\n127mum exercise, its appearance will likely be more eas-ily identiﬁable during exercise at altitude under con-ditions of hypobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, suchexperiments should identify in which organ – heartor skeletal muscle – anaerobiosis ﬁrst becomes ap-parent; the heart, according to the ideas of the pion-eering British and North American exercise physiol-ogists, or the skeletal muscles, according to the inﬂu-ential group of modern exercise physiologists(Noakes 1998).\\nThe original studies of exercise at altitude were\\nundertaken by a research group co-ordinated by Dilland his colleagues from the Harvard fatigue labora-tory. This research established two crucial ﬁndings.First, that peak blood lactate concentrations duringmaximum exercise fell with increasing altitude (Ed-wards 1936), a phenomenon since labelled the ‘‘lac-tate paradox’’ (Hochachka 1989). Second, that maxi-mum heart rate and cardiac output likewise fell dur-ing exercise at increasing altitude (Christensen 1938,Dill 1938).\\nEdwards (1936) interpreted the ‘‘lactate paradox’’\\nat altitude accordingly: ‘‘The inability to accumulatelarge amounts of lactate at high altitudes suggests aprotective mechanism preventing an already low ar-terial saturation from becoming markedly lower ... Itmay be that the protective mechanism lies in an inad-equate oxygen supply to essential muscles, e.g. thediaphragm or the muscles’’.\\nThe existence of the ‘‘lactate paradox’’ was con-\\nﬁrmed during the epic laboratory experiment of exer-cise and acclimatization at simulated high altitude,Operation Everest II (Green et al. 1989). That studyfound that muscle lactate concentrations achievedduring maximal exercise at the highest equivalent alti-tude achieved during that experiment (8848 m –equivalent to the summit of Mount Everest) were nohigher than when at rest at sea level.\\nHence, in as much as high muscle lactate concen-\\ntrations would have to be present if the exercisingmuscles were contracting ‘‘anaerobically’’, this studyproves that exercise at extreme altitude terminateswhen the exercising muscles are contracting in fullyaerobic conditions.\\nSimilarly Operation Everest II (Sutton et al. 1988)\\nconﬁrmed these original and subsequent studies(Pugh 1964, V ogel et al. 1974) showing that heart rateand cardiac output are substantially reduced duringexercise at extreme altitude. The key observation isthat the peak cardiac output falls with increasing alti-tude. This response is equally paradoxical for thosewho believe that the delivery of an adequate oxygensupply to the exercising muscles is the cardinal prior-ity during exercise (Noakes 1998). For logic demandsthat ifthe principal responsibility of the cardiovascu-\\nlar system during exercise is the achievement of an(ultimately inadequate) oxygen supply to skeletal'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Noakes\\nmuscle, then the maximum cardiac output during ex-\\nercise at increasing altitude must either stay the sameor even increase at increasing altitude in order to limitthe effects of the progressive reduction in the arterialoxygen content.\\nY et the evidence is absolutely clear. The heart\\nmakes the exactly opposite adjustment – maximumcardiac output falls with increasing altitude (Suttonet al. 1988). The reduction is due to the reduction inheart rate; stroke volume and myocardial contrac-tility are, if anything, enhanced during peak exerciseat altitude (Reeves et al. 1987, Suarez et al. 1987).Hence the conclusion must be that some currentlyunrecognized mechanism must exist to insure that theheart does not become ‘‘anaerobic’’ during maximalexercise at any altitude – from sea level to the summitof Mount Everest – in healthy humans.\\nInterestingly Christensen, but not Dill, interpreted\\nthis phenomenon correctly: ‘‘Christensen and I dif-fered in our interpretation of his measurements ofrespiratory and circulatory function in exercise (ataltitude). In his opinion, the chief limiting factor isthe ventilation of the lungs. In the hardest grade ofwork at any station, the pulmonary ventilationreached about as high a value as at sea level, while themaximal cardiac output became less as the altitudeincreased. He thinks this means that the heart has anuntapped reserve; it is circulating blood fast enoughto carry to the tissues all the oxygen supplied by thelungs’’ (Dill 1938, p. 170–171).\\nThese studies invite two precise conclusions. First,\\nthat the oxygen demands of the skeletal muscles arenot the cardinal priority and hence are not ‘‘pro-tected’’ during maximum exercise, at least at extremealtitude. Second, neither the skeletal muscles nor theheart becomes ‘‘anaerobic’’ during maximal exercise\\nFig. 4. The ‘‘governor’’ postulated by Hill could be activated by\\na limiting myocardial oxygen delivery. As a result, there wouldbe a reduced activation of the exercising skeletal muscle by thecerebral motor cortex. There is compelling evidence for thepresence of this reﬂex during exercise at altitude (Kayser et al.1994) with the result that neither the heart (Sutton et al. 1988,Reeves et al. 1987, Suzrez et al. 1987) nor the skeletal muscles(Green et al. 1989) develop ‘‘anaerobiosis’’ during maximal ex-ercise at extreme altitude.\\n128under conditions of hypobaric hypoxia. The sole con-\\nclusion must be that some type of ‘‘governor’’, asoriginally proposed by A.V . Hill, must limit maxi-mum exercise at altitude. Furthermore, it would bedifﬁcult to explain why the same control mechanismshould not act similarly during maximum exercise atsea level.\\nIn summary, a number of famous studies have\\nshown that under the precise conditions likely to in-duce anaerobiosis in either the heart or skeletalmuscles – maximal exercise at altitude – neither theheart nor the skeletal muscle show any evidencewhatsoever for ‘‘anaerobic’’ metabolism. This unex-pected ﬁnding can be explained only if there is a‘‘governor’’, probably in the central nervous system,whose function is likely to prevent the developmentof myocardial ischaemia. The same governor couldalso serve the identical function also at sea level,thereby preventing the development of myocardialischaemia during maximum exercise at sea level, ac-cording to Fig. 2. As Dill (1938) concluded, probablycorrectly: ‘‘The capacity of the heart, as has alreadybeen suggested, is restricted at high altitude becauseof the deﬁciency in supply of oxygen to it’’ (p. 15).But the important point is that the heart never actu-ally develops an oxygen deﬁciency at altitude or atsea level; the governor acts to terminate exercise be-fore that deﬁciency becomes apparent.\\nThe ﬁnal conﬁrmation for the presence of this the-\\noretical governor comes from the study of Kayser etal. (1994). They showed that skeletal muscle recruit-ment, measured as skeletal muscle EMG activity atpeak exercise, falls with increasing altitude, but in-creases acutely with oxygen administration. Theyconclude: ‘‘during chronic hypobaric hypoxia, thecentral nervous system may play a primary role inlimiting exhaustive exercise and maximum accumu-lation of lactate in blood’’. This study thereforeproves the existence of the neural effector limb ofHill’s postulated governor (Fig. 4) and its activityduring exercise at altitude.\\nInterestingly, had the human body been designed\\nto function according to the modern physiologists’cardiovascular/anaerobic model, which requires thatanaerobiosis ﬁrst develops in skeletal muscle beforemaximal exercise is terminated, no climber wouldever have reached the summit of Mount Everest orother high mountains, even with the use of sup-plemental oxygen. Rather, all would have succumbedto a combination of myocardial ischaemia and cer-ebral hypoxia whilst their skeletal muscles were exer-cising vigorously and unrestrainedly, in pursuit of an-aerobiosis and fatigue, according to the model de-picted in Fig. 1.\\nFigure 4 therefore summarizes the hypothetical\\nexistence and action of the ‘‘governor’’, ﬁrst proposedby A.V . Hill. It is postulated that receptor(s) exist in'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nthe heart, to assess the adequacy of any of all of the\\nfollowing: coronary blood ﬂow, coronary oxygen de-livery or myocardial or coronary venous oxygen ten-sion. Before any of these reach some predeterminedlimit, the motor cortex in the brain reduces skeletalmuscle activation. As a consequence, skeletal musclerecruitment either fails to rise further or it falls, limit-ing the work output of the body, indicating the onsetof ‘‘fatigue’’. The fall in work output by the bodyreduces myocardial oxygen demand and, as a conse-quence, the threat of myocardial ischaemia is averted.\\nAlternatively it may be that myocardial adenosine\\ntriphosphate (ATP) concentrations are sensed and‘‘defended’’ in much the same way as appears to bethe case for skeletal muscle, as discussed subsequently(Fitts 1994, Spriet et al. 1987). Reduction of myocar-dial ATP concentrations could lead directly to a re-duction in myocardial contractile force as occurs in‘‘myocardial stunning’’ (Braunwald & Kloner 1982).This could explain the onset of cardiac failure duringmaximal exercise in persons with coronary artery dis-ease but could not explain why, at altitude, left ven-tricular function is enhanced during maximal exerciseand shows no evidence for ‘‘fatigue’’.\\nAccordingly, it is proposed that maximal exercise is\\nlimited by a regulated process that terminates exercisebefore the development of a progressive myocardialischaemia, that would precede the development ofskeletal muscle anaerobiosis. This model further pre-dicts that peak coronary blood ﬂow is an importantdeterminant of maximum exercise performance, andthat interventions, including exercise training, that in-crease the maximum cardiac output probably also in-crease the maximum coronary blood ﬂow, as theirmore important effect.\\nBut this model does not exclude the possibility that\\ninterventions could also improve exercise perform-ance by altering either skeletal muscle or myocardialcontractile function or the efﬁciency of oxygen util-ization, or both (Fig. 5).\\nInterestingly, the presence of a ‘‘governor’’ prevent-\\ning the development of anaerobiosis in either heartor skeletal muscle during exercise at altitude has in-teresting implications for theories of the value of ex-ercise training at altitude. For its presence means thatany beneﬁcial effect of altitude training cannot resultfrom repeated exposure of either the heart or exercis-ing skeletal muscle to greater levels of ‘‘anaerobiosis’’than can be achieved during maximal exercise at sealevel. This might explain why there remains consider-able controversy about the proven value of high in-tensity training at altitude (Boning 1997).\\nThe additional paradoxes that (i) adaptation to ex-\\ntreme altitude is associated with reduced skeletalmuscle mitochondrial volume and enzyme content(Green et al. 1989, Oelz et al. 1986, Hoppeler et al.1990); (ii) the skeletal muscle morphology of altitude-\\n129\\nFig. 5. According to the Hill/Noakes Cardiovascular/Neural\\nModel of Exercise Physiology and Athletic Performance, per-formance during maximal exercise is ultimately limited by thepeak coronary blood ﬂow. However, the actual workrateachieved at that peak coronary blood ﬂow would be determinedby the efﬁciency and contractility of both the heart and theactive skeletal muscles.\\nadapted Nepalese Sherpas is not different from that\\nof acclimatized Caucasian climbers (Kayser et al.1991) except that (iii) the volume density of skeletalmuscle mitochondria is signiﬁcantly smaller in Sherp-as than in untrained sedentary subjects (Kayser et al.1991), can best be explained if exercise performanceat altitude is more likely determined by factors pro-ducing superior oxygenation of the heart, than of theskeletal muscles. This model therefore predicts thatcoronary blood ﬂow and perhaps cardiac mitochon-drial mass would be higher in high altitude nativesand superior performers at high altitude. This wouldexplain why high altitude natives achieve almost simi-lar cardiac outputs at sea level and at altitude (V ogelet al. 1974), indicating a lesser activation of the ‘‘gov-ernor’’ during exercise at altitude.\\nIndeed the ability of high altitude natives to\\nachieve high heart rates and cardiac outputs duringexercise at altitude is associated with ‘‘relatively highoxygen tension and saturation’’ (V ogel et al. 1974)compatible with this postulate that superior myocar-dial oxygenation might be an important factor deter-mining exercise capacity at altitude.\\nProlonged submaximal (endurance) exercise\\nMany physiologists, notably in the past (Bainbridge1931, Hill 1927, Dill 1938) but even today (Bassett &Howley 1997), have used this cardiovascular/anaer-obic model also to explain the fatigue that developsduring prolonged submaximal exercise and conse-quently have evoked changes in cardiovascular func-tion to explain the mechanisms by which exercisetraining improves (endurance) performance duringprolonged submaximal exercise.\\nY et it is not entirely apparent why changes in the'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='Noakes\\nTable 2.

An early proponent of this (il)logic wasSir Roger Bannister who wrote in 1956 that: ‘‘Themuscular effort in long-distance running appears tobe limited by cardio-respiratory failure as a wholeand not by premature failure of any part of the inte-gration’’ (Bannister 1956).\\nThe obvious point is that, whereas the cardiovascu-\\nlar system could indeed set the limit for maximal ex-ercise performance because of a limiting capacity toincrease blood ﬂow ﬁrst to the heart, and then to theactive muscles, it is not clear why cardiovascular func-tion should limit prolonged submaximal exercisewhen blood ﬂow and oxygen supply to muscle mustbe adequate. An Olympic analogy from my (African)continent highlights the issues that require debate.\\nIn the years since Wilson Kiprugut won Kenya’s\\nﬁrst Olympic medal by ﬁnishing third in the 800 m atthe 1964 Olympic Games, the dominance byAfricans, especially Kenyans, in distance running hasbecome a phenomenon unequalled in any other sportin the world (Bale & Sang 1996, Tanser 1997). T womeasures of that dominance are provided by theworld rankings of male Kenyan track runners in 1996(Tanser 1997) (Table 2) and of the performances ofthe men and women’s team, both senior and junior,in the W orld Cross-Country championships over thepast 12 years (Tanser 1997) (Table 3). Of particularinterest is the almost total dominance of the 3000 msteeplechase by Kenyans (Table 2). Indeed in excessof 90% of the 100 fastest-ever 3000 m steeplechasetimes in the world have been set by Kenyans. Any\\n130physiological explanation for the Kenyan’s successmust be able also to explain why these physiologicalattributes, uniquely common in Kenyan runners, of-fer an even greater advantage in cross-country eventsand in the steeplechase, rather than at other distancesin which repeated jumping and changes in speed donot occur.\\nT wo studies of Kenyan runners failed to provide a\\ndeﬁnitive physiological answer for their manifest su-periority as distance runners although two of the bestKenyan runners were the most efﬁcient runners yetstudied (Saltin 1996, Saltin et al. 1995a,b) (Fig. 6).The overriding conclusion was that the Kenyans’ VO\\n2\\nmax values were not inordinately high; hence, a su-perior capacity for oxygen consumption during maxi-\\nmum exercise did not explain the Kenyans’ manifest\\nsuperiority during more prolonged submaximal exer-\\ncise. In the words of Bengt Saltin, the senior author:‘‘A comparison of some data on some of the verybest runners in Kenya during the last decades andworld class runners in Scandinavia does not revealmuch that was not already known or could be antici-pated’’ (Saltin 1996).\\nThe only other study of elite (South) African dis-\\ntance runners is that of Coetzer et al. (1993). Thatstudy, which reported physiological data in the bestgroup of distance runners yet evaluated anywhere inthe world, has been largely ignored, for reasons thatare not immediately clear.

The BiomechanicalModel of Exercise Physiology and Athletic Performance pre-dicts that superior running economy would aid elite athleticperformance by reducing both the rate at which heat is pro-duced during exercise as well as the extent to which StretchShortening Cycle Fatigue develops during both training andracing. This theory predicts that the superior running ability ofthe Kenyans may relate, at least in part, to characteristics oftheir skeletal muscle and tendon elasticity (see also Fig. 12).'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nTable 4.

This comparison group wasnot ideal but was necessary because no other readilyavailable group could match the performances of theblack distance runners at any distance over 5 km. Butthe performances of the black and white runners inthat study were at least equal in races of 1–3 km.Table 4 lists the important ﬁndings of that study.\\nThe black distance runners were lighter and\\nsmaller, as also reported by Saltin (1996), with aslightly lower proportion of type I muscle ﬁbres. Butthe key ﬁnding was that the black runners were ableto run substantially faster at all distances beyond 5km despite VO\\n2max values that were the same as\\nthose of the middle distance runners. Hence the car-diovascular/anaerobic model failed to explain the su-perior endurance capacity of the black distance run-ners in that study and perhaps also in the studies ofSaltin and colleagues (Saltin 1996, Saltin et al.1995a,b).\\nRather, the important difference was that the black\\nrunners were able to sustain a substantially higherproportion of their VO\\n2max when racing. This is\\nshown graphically in Fig. 7, which compares the %VO\\n2max sustained by the black and white runners\\nat different racing distances. At distances beyond 5km, black runners sustained a signiﬁcantly higher %VO\\n2max than did the white runners and the differ-\\nence increased with increasing racing distance. Thus,the crucial ﬁnding was that the black distance run-ners have superior fatigue resistance, not a higheraerobic capacity (VO\\n2max). Hence factors distal to\\nthe heart, perhaps in the brain or in the muscles, ap-pear to distinguish the very best runners in the worldfrom those who are almost as good.\\nInterestingly, physiologists have known for at least\\ntwo decades that the % VO\\n2max that athletes can\\nsustain during exercise is an important predictor ofperformance (Costill et al. 1973, Davies & Thompson1979). Y et we have perhaps failed to emphasize, prob-ably because of a devotion to the cardiovascular/an-aerobic model, that this is likely to be a more import-ant determinant of performance in prolonged exer-\\n131cise than is the VO 2max alone. Furthermore, it has\\nnot been appreciated that the % VO 2max sustained\\nduring exercise is a measure of the athlete’s resistanceto fatigue.\\nHence, the important ﬁnding of that study was to\\nshow that the cardiovascular/anaerobic model may beunable to discriminate between very good and su-perior performance in events lasting more than a fewminutes and which constitute the bulk of sportingevents. It is consistent with the ﬁnding that the VO\\n2\\nmax is a relatively poor predictor of endurance per-formance in athletes whose abilities are relativelyhomogenous (Noakes 1988, 1997, 1998, Davies &Thompson 1979, Noakes et al. 1990). The failurestems from the inability of this model to measure orpredict fatigue resistance during prolonged submaxi-\\nmal exercise on the basis of physiological variables\\nand performance measured during a single bout ofprogressive, maximal exercise to exhaustion. Thisconﬁrms that the VO\\n2max test does not measure all\\nthe physiological variables determining success dur-ing more prolonged exercise.\\nFurther support for this explanation can be sur-\\nmised from other information in Fig. 7, which showsthat these athletes run at 100% or greater of theirVO\\n2max in race distances of 1–2 km. Y et it is not at\\nthose distances that the Kenyans’ dominance is mostapparent. If the Kenyans’ success was due to theirunusually high VO\\n2max values, one would expect\\nKenyans also to be dominant at race distances of 800m to the mile, which is not the case (Table 2).\\nIndeed, comparison of the performances of the\\nFig. 7.

Y et the real performance difference occurs at 5km: Komen’s best time is 83 s faster than Coe’s best,a performance difference of 10%.\\nIn summary, there are serious theoretical ﬂaws in\\nthe proposed cardiovascular/anaerobic model of exer-cise physiology and athletic performance (Noakes1998), not least because the model predicts that a‘‘plateau’’ in cardiac output must develop before skel-etal muscle anaerobiosis can begin to occur. But any‘‘plateau’’ in cardiac output requires that myocardialischaemia be present either to cause that plateau (ac-cording to the theory that anaerobiosis limits musclefunction) or as a result of it, as the cardiac outputdetermines both coronary and skeletal muscle bloodﬂow. As myocardial ischaemia has never been shownto develop during maximal exercise in healthyhumans, so it would seem unlikely that skeletalmuscle anaerobiosis can develop during progressiveexercise to exhaustion (Noakes 1998). Rather, itwould seem that ‘‘fatigue’’ during maximal exerciseof short duration is part of a regulated neural processthat prevents the development of myocardial isch-aemia during maximal exercise.\\nWhilst this mechanism is designed to protect the\\nheart from myocardial ischaemia, only indirectly doesit determine the actual peak work rate achieved dur-ing maximal exercise (Fig. 5). The actual peak work-rate achieved will depend on the ‘‘quality’’ of the skel-etal and cardiac muscle. Superior myocardial contrac-tility and efﬁciency of oxygen use would increase themaximum cardiac output achieved at any maximum(limiting) coronary ﬂow. Similarly at any maximumskeletal muscle blood ﬂow, superior contractility andefﬁciency of skeletal muscle contraction would in-crease the peak workrate achieved at that maximumcardiac output. This hypothesis forms what might becalled the Cardiovascular/Neural Recruitment Modelof Exercise Physiology and Athletic Performance.\\nThus, this analysis of the traditional cardiovascu-\\nlar/anaerobic model of exercise performance leads tothe alternate hypothesis that superior fatigue resis-tance, determined perhaps by the central nervous sys-tem or skeletal muscle contractile function, might ex-plain superior performance in events lasting morethan a few minutes. This superior fatigue resistancecannot be predicted by the cardiovascular/anaerobicmodel which uses exercise tests of short duration andin which the fatigue resistance component of endur-ance performance is not measured. By extension, itwould seem that fatigue resistance is not causally de-termined by the magnitude of the athlete’s cardio-vascular capacity. There is also no logical reason tobelieve that fatigue resistance during submaximal ex-\\n132ercise is determined by either the presence or absence\\nof skeletal muscle anaerobiosis.\\nAccordingly, changes in exercise performance that\\nresult from endurance training are unlikely to be de-termined solely by changes in cardiovascular func-tion, with the exception that increases in maximumcoronary blood ﬂow would likely be crucial for anyincreases in maximal cardiac output and hence inVO\\n2max. It is of interest that the vasodilator ca-\\npacity of the major epicardial coronary vessel isgreatly increased in veteran long distance runners(Haskell et al. 1993). Perhaps this indicates that animportant effect of endurance training, possibly atsome critical growth periods, may be to increasemaximum coronary blood ﬂow as shown in animalmodels (Scheuer & Tipton 1997).\\nThe energy supply/energy depletion model\\nThe energy supply model\\nThe central premise in the cardiovascular/anaerobicmodel is that it is the provision of a substrate (oxy-gen) to muscle that limits exercise performance sothat fatigue is a direct consequence of a failure ofoxygen delivery to the exercising muscles. A subtleextension of this idea produces a second model whichproposes that fatigue during high intensity exercisemay, alternatively, result from the inability to supplyanother substrate (ATP) at rates sufﬁciently fast tosustain exercise. Nobel Laureate A. V . Hill, whose re-search in the 1920s was directly responsible for thedevelopment of the cardiovascular/anaerobic modelof exercise performance, also wrote: ‘‘The fact re-mains, however, that the chief factor in many formsof athletic achievement is the supply of energy andits proper and economic utilization’’ (Hill 1927, p.237). Dr Peter Snell, Olympic Gold medallist in the800 and 1500 m and former world record holder hasstated similarly: ‘‘Performance in middle and (long)distance running ultimately depends upon the run-ner’s capacity to produce energy for the duration ofthe event, and on the efﬁciency with which that en-ergy is translated to running velocity. Thus the pur-pose of training is to improve the energy delivery sys-tems, according to the demands of the event and toimprove running economy’’ (Snell 1997).\\nThus, this model predicts that performance in\\nevents of different durations is determined by the ca-pacity to produce energy (ATP) by the different meta-bolic pathways including the phosphagens, oxygen-independent glycolysis, aerobic glycolysis and aerobiclipolysis. Superior performance is then explained bya greater capacity to generate ATP in the speciﬁcmetabolic pathway(s) that predominates during thatactivity. Thus, the sprinter is assumed to have agreater capacity to generate ATP from the intramus-cular phosphagen stores and from oxygen-indepen-'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\ndent glycolysis, whereas the ultramarathon runner\\nhas a superior capacity to oxidize fat (aerobic lipoly-sis) (Hawley & Hopkins 1995).\\nWhether this hypothesis is true is uncertain as it\\nhas yet to be systematically evaluated. T o prove thismodel would require (i) that the metabolic capacitiesof these different pathways be shown to be causallyrelated to performance in events lasting the differentdurations; (ii) that the speciﬁc metabolic pathways beshown to adapt predictably with speciﬁc training, and(iii) that these adaptations alone explain the changesin performance that result from training with exer-cises lasting the different durations. Until thesestudies are completed, this model remains hypotheti-cal, but interesting. It must be remembered that thetruth of this model would need to disprove the op-posing model, described in the previous section,which holds that maximal exercise performance is aregulated process limited by a failure of central neuralrecruitment. Fatigue at exhaustion, caused by a fail-ure of central recruitment, will always appear to be\\ndue to a failure of ATP production unless the alter-nate possibility is studied (and excluded) simul-taneously.\\nThe argument against this model has been intro-\\nduced elsewhere (Noakes 1997). In short, the predic-tion of this model is that exercise must terminatewhen muscle ATP depletion occurs (Fitts 1994), thatis when the muscle develops rigor. Y et here again, theevidence appears clear. ATP concentrations, even inmuscles forced to contract under ischaemic con-ditions, do not drop below about 60% of restingvalues (Fitts 1994, Spriet et al. 1987, Hochachka1994) indicating that muscle ATP concentrations are‘‘defended’’ in order to prevent the development ofskeletal muscle rigor. As Fitts (1994) has concluded:‘‘The overriding evidence suggests that (the high en-ergy phosphates) do not participate in the fatigueprocess; that fatigue produced by other factors re-duces the ATP utilization rate before ATP becomeslimiting. The most compelling evidence for this con-clusion is that cell ATP rarely falls below 70% of thepre-exercise level, even in cases of exercise fatigue’’ (p.82).\\nHence, is appears that the rate of ATP demand by\\nthe contracting muscles can never exceed the maxi-mum rate of ATP supply because of the closematching of ATP demand to the available ATP sup-ply (Spriet et al. 1987, Hochachka 1994).\\nThere is an obvious analogy to the centrally situ-\\nated neural ‘‘governor’’ that prevents the develop-ment of myocardial ischaemia during maximal exer-cise at either sea level or altitude. The difference isthat the ‘‘governor’’ identiﬁed by Spriet et al. (1987)is clearly located in the periphery and acts even inmuscles stimulated to contract with an externally ap-plied current.\\n133It is of interest that the presence of this peripheral\\n‘‘governor’’ is an essential component of the cardio-vascular/anaerobic model as originally conceivedfrom the work of Hill and his colleagues, and stillwidely promoted (Fig. 1). This hypothesis holds thatwhen the rate of ATP production by oxidative sourcesbecomes inadequate, high rates of ‘‘anaerobic’’ glyco-lytic ATP production produce metabolites, particu-larly H\\n¹, which interfere with energy production and\\ncross-bridge cycling causing fatigue and a failure ofmuscle contraction (Fitts 1994). In this way, musclecontraction fails not because of a failure of centralrecruitment (as predicted by the Cardiovascular/Neu-ral Recruitment Model – previous section), but be-cause of a peripherally located inhibition of muscularcontraction. Proponents of this model can cite a largebody of evidence showing that a number of metabo-lites can interfere with muscle cross-bridge cyclingmeasured in vitro in isolated muscle ﬁbres (Fitts\\n1994). The necessary assumption is that skeletalmuscle contracting in vitro in the absence of an intact\\nneural system behaves exactly as it would in vivo\\nwhen the inﬂuences from the central nervous systemare intact. But there is a body of evidence that is notcompatible with these assumptions and conclusions.\\nFor example, one of the few studies to evaluate\\ncritically this hypothesis that metabolites, particu-larly H\\n¹, can induce skeletal muscle fatigue, is that\\nof Mannion et al. (1995). They found that there is awide range of muscle pH concentrations reached atexhaustion during intense exercise showing that if anaccumulation of H\\n¹limits high intensity exercise in\\nvivo, then ‘‘considerable interindividual differences\\nmust exist in the pH sensitivities of the various pro-cesses involved’’ (Mannion et al. 1995, p. 98).\\nNext, they found that in contrast to the prediction\\nfrom in vitro studies, subjects with the highest pro-\\nportion of type II muscle ﬁbres were able to exerciseto the lowest muscle pH concentrations. In contrast,in vitro studies have suggested that type I muscle\\nﬁbres are more resistant to acidosis than are type IIﬁbres. Finally, the authors found that subjects witha greater skeletal muscle buffering capacity did notaccumulate more lactate during maximal exercise;nor were they able to exercise for longer than didthose with lesser muscle buffering capacity. They con-cluded that ‘‘if acidosis makes any contribution to thefatigue during performance of this (high intensity)type of exercise, it is an indirect one ... ’’.\\nOne possibility is that such exercise is terminated\\nby a central governor responding to factors otherthan skeletal muscle pH. Under these circumstancesthere would be no relationship between the onset offatigue and muscle acidosis. This would not negatethe established ﬁnding that in vivo , acidosis inhibits\\ncrossbridge cycling (Fitts 1994). It would mean onlythat this mechanism is not relevant in exercising'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='Noakes\\nhumans, perhaps because exercise terminates for\\nother reasons, in particular to prevent the develop-ment of myocardial ischaemia, before the limitingskeletal muscle pH is reached.\\nOther relevant ﬁndings include the study of Bog-\\ndanis et al. (1995), who showed that recovery ofmuscle function following maximal sprint cycling ex-ercise was related to recovery of muscle phospho-creatine concentrations and unrelated to muscle pHconcentrations during recovery. In addition, V ollestadet al. (1988) showed that the gradual decline in maxi-mum force generation in subjects performing re-peated submaximal contractions for 40–70 min was‘‘not due to lactacidosis or lack of substrates for ATPresynthesis and must have resulted from excitation/contraction coupling failure ... ’’. Y et terminal exhaus-tion was associated with depletion of intramuscularphosphagen stores, but without evidence for acidosis.\\nIn summary, a metabolic basis limiting high inten-\\nsity exercise of short duration is widely assumed butincompletely documented. There is a need to estab-lish whether those metabolic factors that appear tolimit muscle function in vitro also play a role in vivo\\nwhen the muscle is also under the inﬂuence of thecentral nervous system. Thus, the possible contri-bution of neural factors to this form of fatigue needsto be excluded before results from in vitro studies are\\nextrapolated, without qualiﬁcation, to the in vivo\\ncondition.\\nThe energy depletion model\\nThe related energy depletion model of exercise per-formance is speciﬁc for exercise lasting more than 2–3 h. It holds, in essence, that: ‘‘Depletion of endoge-nous carbohydrate stores has been shown to be a lim-iting factor in the ability to perform long term exer-cise’’ (Costill et al. 1973). The ﬁndings that supportthis conclusion are (i) that fatigue during prolongedexercise is associated with depletion of liver (causing\\nhypoglycaemia) or muscle glycogen stores (Fitts 1994,Bosch et al. 1993, Coggan & Coyle 1987, Coyle et al.1986, Tsintzas et al. 1996), or both; (ii) that reversalof hypoglycaemia allows exercise to continue(Coggan & Coyle 1987, Coyle et al. 1986, Tsintzas etal. 1996, Christensen & Hansen 1939) and (iii) thatpre-exercise muscle glycogen supercompensation(carbohydrate-loading) (Hawley et al. 1997) or carbo-hydrate ingestion during exercise (Coyle et al. 1986),or both (Bosch et al. 1996), delays the onset of fatigueand improves exercise performance.\\nHowever, it must be remembered that relatively few\\ncarbohydrate-loading studies have been conductedwith an adequate placebo control group. It seemshighly improbable that neither athletes nor re-searchers are completely unaware of the widely re-ported beneﬁts of carbohydrate-loading and thatsuch knowledge is without effect on the ﬁndings of\\n134these trials. Indeed, two of the ﬁrst such trials whichincluded adequate placebo-controlled groups haveboth failed to ﬁnd any ergogenic effect of pre-exercisecarbohydrate loading (Burke et al. 1999, Hawley etal. 1997) under experimental conditions when suchan effect might have been expected.\\nThe ﬁnding that the reversal of hypoglycaemia\\nalone allows exercise performance to continue(Coggan & Coyle 1987, Christensen & Hansen 1939)proves conclusively that liver glycogen depletion isone form of energy (carbohydrate) depletion that candeﬁnitely limit exercise performance. Interestingly,the rapidity with which the reversal of hypoglycaemiarestores exercise performance indicates that a centralneural ‘‘governor’’ must be active, similar to that acti-vated during high intensity exercise at altitude. How-ever, this control would be activated by changes inblood glucose concentrations and would act to pre-vent continuing high rates of muscle contraction andblood glucose oxidation that would further reducethe blood glucose concentration, risking hypogly-caemic cerebral damage.\\nBut, in as much as no technique has yet been de-\\nvised that will instantly reverse muscle glycogen de-pletion, in the same way that intravenous glucose in-fusion or oral glucose ingestion rapidly reverses hy-poglycaemia, so it is impossible to prove conclusivelythat muscle glycogen depletion alone limits prolonged\\nexercise performance. It needs to be remembered thatthere are many physiological changes besides muscleglycogen depletion that develop during exercise, andthat any or all of these could contribute to, or causefatigue during prolonged exercise. In addition, rela-tively little attention has been paid to the possiblerole of central (neural) fatigue (Davis & Bailey 1997)asthefactor limiting prolonged exercise when muscle\\nglycogen concentrations are also very low. Futurestudies of the energy depletion model need to showthat central neural factors do not cause the fatiguecurrently ascribed to the development of muscle gly-cogen depletion during prolonged exercise.\\nThus, the belief that muscle glycogen depletion\\ncauses fatigue is an interesting hypothesis that is sup-ported logically by the ﬁndings that subjects who areexhausted during prolonged exercise develop very lowmuscle glycogen content (Fitts 1994, Bosch et al.1993, Tsintzas et al. 1996, Burke et al. 1999), and thatmuscle glycogen is the metabolic fuel required for sus-tained high intensity exercise (Bosch et al. 1993). Itwould seem logical to assume that the two are caus-ally linked at exhaustion during prolonged exercise;namely, that the near absence of muscle glycogen inexhausted subjects explains why they are unable tomaintain, let alone increase, their exercise intensity atexhaustion. The ﬁnding that the vast majority of themodern and historical carbohydrate-loading studiesshow that this technique improves endurance per-'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nformance, presumably by increasing muscle glycogen\\nutilization and delaying the onset of terminal muscleglycogen depletion, strongly supports the theory(Hawley et al. 1997). However, the possibility thatpart or all of these ﬁndings could also result froma placebo effect, acting through the central nervoussystem, needs to be considered (Burke et al. 1999). Inaddition, it is unclear how the inability to produceATP at sufﬁciently high rates from one fuel sourcecan explain this form of fatigue, given that skeletalmuscle ATP concentrations remain high at exhaus-tion (as they do in all other forms of exhaustion(Fitts 1994)).\\nNevertheless, there is a body of evidence that con-\\nﬂicts with the predictions of this hypothesis. For ex-ample, the classic study of Coyle et al. (1986) showedthat athletes ingesting carbohydrate terminated exer-cise after 4 h when their muscle glycogen concen-trations and rates of carbohydrate oxidation were thesame as values measured 1 h earlier when the athleteswere not exhausted. Another study found that ath-letes who adapted to a high fat diet were able to exer-cise to signiﬁcantly lower muscle glycogen concen-trations at exhaustion than when they were carbo-hydrate adapted (Lambert et al. 1994).\\nConversely, Helge et al. (1996) showed that pre-\\nviously untrained subjects who trained on a high fatdiet for 7 weeks before switching to a high carbo-hydrate diet for one week increased their pre-exercisemuscle glycogen concentrations by 44% with only asmall further increase in performance between theseventh and eighth weeks of the trial. Furthermore,performance was still substantially worse in fat-adapted subjects than it was in subjects who trainedfor 8 weeks on a high carbohydrate diet and whosepre-exercise muscle glycogen concentrations were32% lower than fat-adapted athletes exposed to ahigh carbohydrate diet for one week.\\nIn addition, exercise performance evaluated on 3\\noccasions in both dietary groups terminated beforethere was marked muscle glycogen depletion. Theauthors concluded: ‘‘Factors other than carbohydrateavailability are responsible for the differences in en-durance time between the groups’’ (p. 303); and‘‘These observations also indicate that fatigue duringprolonged moderately intense exercise does not al-ways seem to be closely related to glycogen depletion,as is usually stated’’ (Christensen & Hansen 1939,Bergstrom et al. 1967). In his extensive review, Fitts(1994) similarly concludes: ‘‘It seems unlikely thatmuscle glycogen depletion, low blood glucose, andthe resultant decline in carbohydrate oxidation is anexclusive fatigue factor during prolonged exercise’’.He does, however, acknowledge that ‘‘a possibilityexists that muscle glycogen depletion is causative infatigue via a mechanism independent of its role inenergy production’’ (p. 83).\\n135In addition, to my knowledge, no study has yet es-\\ntablished that training improves endurance perform-ance exclusively by increasing body carbohydratestores and by delaying the onset of carbohydrate de-pletion during prolonged exercise in humans, al-though this ﬁnding has been reported in rats (Fitts etal. 1975) whose metabolism is substantially differentfrom that of humans.\\nSimilarly, it is currently difﬁcult to explain perform-\\nance in ultra-endurance events, especially the ﬁnal 42km running leg of the 226 km Ironman triathlonevents according to this model, which holds that exer-cise of moderately high intensity is not possible oncethere is marked muscle glycogen depletion. After cyc-ling at 40 km Áh\\n»1for 4.5 h, the lead cyclists would be\\nexpected to have near total muscle glycogen depletionaccording to data from laboratory studies (Bosch et al.1993). Y et the best performers in that event are able torun at close to 16 km Áh\\n»1for a further 160 min. This\\nprobably represents an exercise intensity of ±66% VO 2\\nmax. The studies of Rauch et al. (1998) and O’Brien\\net al. (1993) suggest that total carbohydrate oxidationduring very prolonged exercise of up to 6 h durationexceeds the estimated carbohydrate stores in liver andactive muscle by up to 100%. Either these calculationsare incorrect, or other sources of carbohydrate, in ad-dition to those in the active muscles and liver, mustcontribute to fuel oxidation in events lasting more than4–6 h. One possibility is that lactate oxidation of glyco-gen stored in the inactive skeletal muscles contributesa substantial additional amount to fuel use during veryprolonged exercise (Rauch et al. 1998). How increasedlactate oxidation contributes to performance is notknown.\\nSimilarly, provision of carbohydrate at high rates\\nintravenously (Coggan & Coyle 1987) cannot extendexercise performance indeﬁnitely. Whilst this couldsupport the argument that muscle glycogen is theim-\\nportant carbohydrate source limiting exercise per-formance, the alternate possibility is that anotherfactor, unrelated to depletion of body carbohydratestores, perhaps a rising body temperature discussedsubsequently, or central neural fatigue induced byother factors, may also limit endurance performance.\\nPerhaps there is a necessary rate of carbohydrate\\noxidation that is required to sustain a speciﬁc exerciseintensity and that progressive whole body carbo-hydrate depletion lowers that rate, inducing fatigue.If this is correct, then fatigue resistance during pro-longed exercise could be due to the capacity to sus-tain a higher rate of carbohydrate oxidation, andhence a higher respiratory quotient (RQ) during pro-\\nlonged exercise. Again, this model suffers from thepersisting logical impasse that a failure to generateATP sufﬁciently rapidly must cause exercise to ter-minate because of muscle ATP depletion and rigor, aphenomenon which does not occur (Fitts 1994).'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='Noakes\\nFig. 8. Laboratory simulation suggests that an elite cyclist cyc-\\nling 180 km in 4 h 30 min would cycle at an oxygen consump-tion of 57 ml/kg/min. Based on the measured contribution offat and carbohydrate oxidation to this energy requirement (col-umns on the left of the ﬁgure), this would require the oxidationof about 700 g of carbohydrate and 175 g of fat. This comparesto the predicted maximum body stores of 520 g of carbohydrateand 5000 g of fat in an elite triathlete. Hence this model predictsthat the elite triathlete must commence the running leg of thetriathlon with very low or absent whole body carbohydratestores.\\nAn equally plausible alternate theory postulates\\nthat superior endurance capacity may be determinedby the exact opposite; by a superior capacity to oxid-ize fat and hence maintain a lower RQ during pro-\\nlonged exercise. The latter possibility is supported byat least some evidence. In the studies of Bosch et al.(1993), those athletes unable to complete 3 h of exer-cise at 70% VO\\n2max after carbohydrate-loading had\\nsigniﬁcantly higher RQ during exercise and weretherefore characterized by an inability to sustain highrates of fat oxidation during prolonged exercise. In-deed, simulated metabolic balance studies for the 226km Hawaiian Ironman triathlon suggest it to be verylikely that the capacity to oxidize fat at high rates willinﬂuence running speed late in the race when calcu-lations suggest that muscle glycogen stores are likelyto be depleted.\\nFigure 8 shows the expected energy metabolism\\nduring 4.5 h cycling at an oxygen consumption of 57ml/kg/min. This is equivalent to cycling at 40 km/hand completing the 180 km cycle leg of the Ironmantriathlon in the time necessary to be amongst the raceleaders. The data for this simulation come from lab-oratory data measured on elite South African cyclists(I. Rodger. Unpublished data).\\nThe simulation predicts that after 4.5 h of cycling\\nan elite male Ironman triathlete would be expected tohave oxidized about 700 g of carbohydrate and 175 gof fat. This compares to predicted whole body carbo-hydrate and fat stores of 520 g and 5000 g, respec-tively. Hence this model predicts that, at the end ofthe cycle leg, an elite athlete would have depleted his\\n136body carbohydrate stores, yet must still run 42.2 kmat close to 16 km/h if he wishes to be successful.\\nOur other laboratory data suggest that after 4.5 h\\nof such exercise, the carbohydrate contribution towhole body energy metabolism would comprise ablood glucose oxidation rate of 1.2 g/min (21 kJ/min)and a lactate oxidation rate of 0.6 g/min (10.5 kJ/min). T ogether with the average maximum rate of fatoxidation that we have measured after 6 h of labora-tory cycling (0.76 g/min; 28 kJ/min), this provides atotal rate of energy production of 59.5 kJ/min. Thiswould provide energy at a rate sufﬁcient to sustain arunning speed of approximately 12 km/h, sufﬁcientto complete the 42 km marathon leg of the Ironmantriathlon i n3h3 0m i n (Fig. 9). T o equal the best\\nmarathon time yet run in that race, the athlete wouldbe required to oxidize fat at a rate of 1.15 g/min (Fig.10). This rate is approximately 50% faster than wehave measured in cyclists in our laboratory.\\nAccordingly, if this metabolic model of fatigue in\\nthe Ironman triathlon is correct, then the differencebetween running the ﬁnal marathon in 2 h 40 minversus 3 h 30 min may simply be a 51% (0.4 g/min)\\nFig. 9. The top panel of this ﬁgure shows the oxygen require-\\nment (VO 2), the exercise intensity (% VO 2max) and the rates\\nof energy expenditure that would be sustained by a world-classathlete completing the ﬁnal 42.2 km marathon running leg ofthe Ironman triathlon in times of either 2 h 40 min; 3 h 00 min;or 3 h 30 min. Laboratory studies suggest that after a 3.8 kmswim and a 180 km cycle, the athlete’s body carbohydrate storeswould be depleted so that energy for the running leg wouldcome from oxidation of (mainly ingested) blood glucose, bloodlactate and from circulating free fatty acids derived from muscleand adipose tissue triglyceride. T o complete the marathon run-ning leg of the Ironman triathlon in 3 h 30 min, the athletewould have to sustain a VO\\n2of 42 ml/kg/min (52% VO 2max),\\nequivalent to an energy expenditure of 59.5 kJ/min. Laboratorysimulations (Fig. 8) suggest that under these conditions of neartotal carbohydrate depletion, peak glucose oxidation rates are1.2 g/min and peak lactate (from glycogen) oxidation rates are0.6 g/min. If these data for the maximum capacity to oxidizeglucose and lactate in the carbohydrate-depleted state are cor-rect, then to sustain the rate of energy expenditure necessary torun the marathon in 03:30:00, the carbohydrate-depleted tri-athlete must oxidize fat at a rate of 0.76 g/min.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nFig. 10. T o complete the marathon running leg of the Ironman\\ntriathlon in 2 h 40 min, currently the fastest running time yetrecorded in the Hawaiian Ironman triathlon, the athlete wouldhave to sustain a VO\\n2of 53 ml/kg/min (66% VO 2max), equiva-\\nlent to an energy expenditure of 74 kJ/min. If the maximumcapacity to oxidize glucose and lactate in the carbohydrate-de-pleted state is unchanged from values given in Fig. 9, then tosustain such a high rate of energy expenditure, the athlete mustoxidize fat at a rate of 1.15 g/min. This model predicts that thesuperior ability of the elite Ironman triathlete may result froma much greater (approximately 50%) capacity to oxidize fatthan has been measured in our laboratory experiments of veryprolonged laboratory exercise involving sub-elite athletes(Rauch et al. 1998).\\ngreater capacity to oxidize fat when body carbo-\\nhydrate and, especially, muscle glycogen stores aredepleted. Of course, this model does not negate therequirement that such high rates of fat oxidationcan only be achieved if the central nervous systemcontinues to recruit an appropriately large numberof muscle ﬁbres able to produce an appropriateforce.\\nIn summary, the human body has a limited ca-\\npacity to store carbohydrates. In addition, high ratesof carbohydrate oxidation are necessary to sustainhigh rates of energy expenditure (in the fed state).Furthermore, studies of very prolonged exercise (6 h)show that rates of carbohydrate oxidation remainhigh in athletes who ingest appropriate amounts ofcarbohydrate during exercise (Rauch et al. 1998). Asboth muscle and liver glycogen depletion occur in thefatigued state, it has popularly been assumed thatthere is a direct causal relationship between, espe-cially, muscle glycogen depletion and the develop-ment of fatigue during prolonged exercise. Y et someﬁndings suggest that this relationship may not bestrictly causal under all circumstances. In addition isthe logical impasse which requires that any energydepletion model predicts that exercise must terminatewhen muscle ATP depletion occurs, leading to musclerigor. In the absence of such evidence, it would seemthat factors in addition to depletion of body carbo-hydrate store may contribute to, or even cause, fa-tigue during prolonged exercise.\\n137At present, no study has conclusively established\\nthat training-induced changes in the capacity to storeand metabolize carbohydrate during prolonged exer-cise are causally related to training-induced changesin performance in humans, although this relationshipis frequently assumed. The alternate possibility isthat the capacity to oxidize fat at high rates whenbody carbohydrate stores are depleted, may delay fa-tigue and determine performance during exercise ofmoderately high intensity that lasts more than 4 hand is typiﬁed by ultradistance running and triathlonevents (Fig. 8–10).\\nIn this regard, the ‘‘crossover’’ concept of Brooks\\nand Mercier (1994) is of particular interest. Theseauthors argue that fuel choice during exercise‘‘crosses over’’ from predominantly fat to exclusivelycarbohydrate at exercise intensities above about 80%VO\\n2max. They conclude that training produces dif-\\nferent effects depending on the intensity of the exer-cise being evaluated. At exercise intensities belowtheir ‘‘crossover’’ point, training increases fat oxi-dation whereas at higher exercise intensities, trainingincreases the capacity to burn carbohydrates. Accord-ing to their concept, exercise at higher intensities(±70% VO\\n2max) would be limited as an example of\\nenergy supply limitations (an inability to sustain highrates of carbohydrate oxidation), whereas exercise atlower intensities would be limited by muscle glycogendepletion. In fact the models are identical – accordingto the energy (muscle glycogen) depletion model, fa-tigue results from an inability to supply ATP sufﬁ-ciently rapidly from fat oxidation (failure of energysupply from fat oxidation). The opposite pertainsduring high intensity exercise. In fact, as argued hereand elsewhere (Fitts 1994), both the energy supplyand the energy depletion models predict that muscleATP depletion limits exercise. This does not occur;hence, the models must be too simplistic to explainwhat has been found.\\nThe muscle recruitment (central fatigue)/muscle power\\nmodel\\nThe two previous models are based on the assump-\\ntion that it is either the delivery of substrate eitherin blood (oxygen) or via the glycolytic and oxidativepathways (ATP) that limits exercise performance. Thesteps of (il)logic that have inﬂuenced these assump-tions have been described (Noakes 1997, 1998). It re-mains difﬁcult to prove whether or not either of thesemodels is correct. Y et both continue to dominate, per-haps subconsciously, research and teaching in the ex-ercise sciences, often to the exclusion of competingpossibilities.\\nAn alternate view is that it is not the rate of supply\\nof substrate, either oxygen or fuel, to muscle that lim-its its performance but rather the processes involved'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='Noakes\\nin skeletal muscle recruitment, excitation and con-\\ntraction.\\nA failure of central nervous system recruitment of\\nskeletal muscle forms the basis for the ‘‘central (ner-vous system) fatigue’’ hypothesis (Davis & Bailey1997). This model holds that the brain concentrationof serotonin (and perhaps other neurotransmitters,including dopamine and acetylcholine) alters the den-sity of the neural impulses reaching the exercisingmuscles, thereby inﬂuencing the rate at which fatiguedevelops, especially during exercise. Alternatively,there may be inhibitory reﬂexes arising from the exer-cising muscles and which feedback to the spinal cord,reducing skeletal muscle recruitment at the level ofthea-motoneuron. The evidence for both mechan-\\nisms has been extensively reviewed (Davis & Bailey1997).\\nIn brief, a number of studies indicate that manipu-\\nlation of central nervous system neurotransmitterconcentrations, in particular increasing dopamineand reducing serotonin concentrations, can enhanceexercise performance whereas the opposite impairsperformance. In addition, there is direct evidence forreduced central neural drive to muscle after fatiguingmuscle contractions (Behm & St-Pierre 1997, Bakeret al. 1993, Newham et al. 1991). This evidence issufﬁciently persuasive to believe that central nervoussystem fatigue contributes to fatigue during pro-longed exercise lasting tens of minutes to hours.\\nThe clear evidence that fatigue at high altitude is\\ncaused by reduced central nervous system recruit-ment of the exercising muscles has been described. Itis very likely that the fatigue that occurs during exer-cise in the heat is also likely limited by a failure ofcentral recruitment as this form of fatigue cannot beexplained by any other model. Thus, there is nowsubstantive evidence that each athlete can store onlysome limiting amount of heat before being forced toreduce the exercise intensity or alternatively cease ex-ercising altogether (Nielsen et al. 1990, 1993, 1997).There is no evidence from these studies that exhaus-tion under these conditions is associated with eitherskeletal muscle ‘‘anaerobiosis’’ or energy depletion.Rather, that it is either the total heat accumulated orits rate of accumulation that limits exercise is con-ﬁrmed by intervention studies which show that pre-cooling improves performance (Nielsen et al. 1997,Booth et al. 1997) whereas pre-heating has the op-posite effect (Gongalez-Alonso et al. 1999).\\nIn summary, there is sufﬁcient evidence to suggest\\nthat a reduced central nervous system recruitment ofthe active muscles terminates maximum exercise athigh altitudes (and probably also at sea level). Thesame mechanism likely terminates exercise in the heatwhen the body temperature reaches some limitingmaximum and also when hypoglycaemia develops. Inall these examples, reduced central recruitment of\\n138muscle would function to prevent organ damage(Noakes 1997).\\nHowever, the contrasting ﬁnding that skeletal\\nmuscle recruitment, measured as skeletal muscle elec-tromyographic activity, rises during exercise at thesame workload (Takaishi et al. 1994), is usually inter-preted as evidence for a progressive failure of muscleﬁbre contractile function requiring additional ﬁbrerecruitment if the required force is to be sustained.Thus, this model holds that there is a progressive pe-ripheral fatigue for which the central nervous systemmakes an appropriate adjustment.\\nY et these studies usually impose a constant work-\\nload on the subject for the duration of the activity.But competitive sport does not usually involve suchconstant workrates; workrates tend to vary in arandom, stochastic way (Palmer et al. 1994). W efound that during prolonged exercise, which in-cludes bouts of self-chosen high intensity exercisedesigned to simulate stochastic exercise, there is aprogressive reduction in power output during thebouts of high intensity exercise (Burke et al. 1999).This strongly suggests central fatigue in which, dur-ing bouts of exercise requiring a near maximum ef-fort, there is an inadequate increase in central neu-ral drive to compensate for the expected reductionin the power output of the fatiguing skeletal muscleﬁbres (peripheral fatigue). That a relatively smallpercentage of the available muscle mass is ever re-cruited, even during maximal exercise (Sloniger etal. 1997), remains a perplexing but relatively under-recognized enigma. Proponents of any model of pe-ripheral limitations for exercise performance needto explain why the body does not recruit all itsavailable muscle mass to produce the necessaryforce under varying exercise conditions as so-called‘‘peripheral fatigue’’ develops.\\nIn summary, one interpretation of the muscle re-\\ncruitment (central fatigue) model is that changes incentral neurotransmitters induce fatigue simply as anatural consequence of prolonged exercise andchanges in the relative balance of the different (ergo-genic and ergolytic) neurotransmitters in the brain.No speciﬁc physiological value or importance is as-signed to this phenomenon.\\nAlternatively, I have argued that a reduced central\\nactivation of the exercising muscles may be necessaryto protect the human under speciﬁc conditions(Noakes 1997, 1998). It is postulated that these con-trol mechanisms are necessary (i) to prevent myocar-dial ischaemia during exercise at high intensity; (ii) toprevent the development of muscle ATP depletionand muscle rigor during high intensity exercise; (iii)to prevent myocardial ischaemia or cerebral hypoxiaduring exercise at altitude; (iv) to prevent a fall inblood pressure during exercise in patients withchronic heart failure; (v) to prevent heatstroke during'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nprolonged exercise in the heat, and (vi) to prevent glu-\\ncopaenic brain damage during prolonged exercisewhen hypoglycaemia results from liver glycogen de-pletion. The likely mechanism of control is throughthe regulation either of skeletal muscle recruitment orof excitation/contraction coupling in the muscle.\\nMuscle power model\\nThis model holds that muscle contractile capacity,that is the ability of individual muscle cross-bridgesto generate force, is not the same in the muscles ofall humans, so that those with superior athletic abil-ity have muscles with a superior capacity to generateforce (superior contractility) by the individual cross-bridges of the different muscle ﬁbres. This model iswell accepted by cardiac physiologists, the majorityof whom would argue that calcium delivery to themyoﬁbres and the activity of the enzyme involved inATP hydrolysis, myosin ATPase, rather than sub-strate supply, determine the contractile state of themyocardium in both health and disease (Opie 1998).\\nI could ﬁnd only one recent statement using this\\nmodel to explain superior athletic performance,speciﬁcally in swimming: ‘‘First, the strength of themuscles used in swimming is a major determinant ofsuccess in events from 50 m to 1500 m. Though thismay not seem surprising, it must be remembered thatstrength per se does not dictate fast swimming. The\\nforces generated by the muscle must be effectively ap-plied to the water if they are to propel the body. Thus,strength speciﬁcity is the key to swimming success’’(Costill et al. 1992).\\nThere are rather few studies of the contractility of\\nskeletal muscle isolated from athletes. These studiesgenerally show that endurance training reduces skel-etal muscle contractility (Fitts et al. 1989, Widrick etal. 1996). This establishes that skeletal muscle con-tractility is not an immutable characteristic of the dif-ferent muscle ﬁbre types (Fitss & Widrick 1996). Byextension, one might speculate that the contractilityof the speciﬁc muscle ﬁbre types might differ betweenathletes of different abilities in different sportingdisciplines, compatible with this muscle power model.\\nIn summary, these two models of exercise perform-\\nance predict that changes in exercise performancemay result from increased skeletal muscle recruitmentresulting from enhanced central neural drive, or fromincreased muscle contractile function resulting frombiochemical adaptations in muscle that increaseeither force production or the rate of sarcomereshortening, or both.\\nHowever, the increase in performance resulting\\nfrom these adaptations would occur only to the ex-tent that the cardiovascular limits for exercise per-formance were not exceeded, according to the Car-diovascular/Neural Model.\\n139The biomechanical model\\nThere is growing interest in the role of muscles as\\nelastic energy return systems which function both assprings and torque producers during exercise (Pennisi1997, Roberts et al. 1997). Central to this model isthe prediction that the greater the muscle’s capacityto act as a spring, the less torque it must produce andhence the more efﬁcient it is. The more efﬁcient, moreelastic muscle will enhance exercise performance,especially in weight-bearing activities, by slowing (i)the rate of accumulation of those metabolites thatmay cause fatigue during exercise, and (ii) the rate ofrise of body temperature, thereby delaying theachievement of the core temperature that prevents thecontinuation of exercise.\\nThis new information underscores another import-\\nant logical weakness of the cardiovascular/anaerobicmodel for explaining enhanced endurance perform-ance. For that model predicts that superior perform-ance during prolonged exercise results from an in-\\ncreased oxygen delivery to muscle and an increased\\nrate of energy and hence heat production. Thus, ac-cording to that model, the price of running faster isthat more heat must be produced. But a higher rateof heat production would induce fatigue prematurelydue to excessive heat accumulation, according to theﬁndings of Nielsen and colleagues (Nielsen et al.1993, 1997). A more logical biological adaptationwould be to reduce the rate of oxygen consumption\\nand hence the rate of heat production by increasingthe athlete’s efﬁciency (economy) of movement.\\nIndeed, if the rate of heat accumulation limits exer-\\ncise performance under speciﬁc conditions, then fac-tors that slow the rate at which heat accumulateswhen running fast should enhance performance. T wosuch factors are small size (Dennis & Noakes 1999)and superior running economy. A smaller size reducesthe amount of heat produced when running at anyspeed. When environmental conditions limit the ca-pacity for heat loss, smaller runners will be favoured(Dennis & Noakes 1999).\\nFurther evidence supporting this argument that\\nheat accumulation is a factor limiting endurance per-formance, is the ﬁnding that race times in both themarathon (Noakes 1992) and the longer distancetrack races including the 3000 m steeplechase and the10 000 m (McCann & Adams 1997) deteriorate as theenvironmental heat load increases. Thus, there is aninverse relationship between the environmental heatload, measured as the W et Bulb Globe T emperatureIndex, and the reduction in race performance.\\nTherefore, according to this model, the more econ-\\nomical the athlete, the faster he or she will be able torun before reaching a limiting body temperature. Anumber of studies indicate that the best enduranceathletes are also frequently the most economical'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='Noakes\\n(Noakes 1992; Fig. 6). Indeed, most training studies\\nshow that improvements in running economy are per-haps the most likely response to training, especiallyin those who are already well-trained (Svedenhag &Sjodin 1985). This adaptation allows the athlete torun faster at the same oxygen consumption; thus, heor she completes a given distance more rapidly forthe same average rate of heat accumulation but a re-duced overall heat expenditure. This would be advan-tageous under conditions in which the heat load onthe athlete increases (during the day).\\nFigure 11 shows that this adaptation may indeed\\nexist. In a cross-sectional study of recreational (notelite) ultramarathon runners, it was found that thosewho trained more were more economical and hencecould run faster at the same oxygen consumption or %VO\\n2max. During competition, the better trained\\nathletes ran at the same or a slightly lower % VO 2max\\nbut completed the races in a shorter time (Scrimgeouret al. 1986). Hence being more economical, not havinga higher VO\\n2max, appears to be a more logical tech-\\nnique to enhance endurance performance.\\nIn contrast, a high aerobic capacity, often a marker\\nof poor running economy (Noakes 1988, 1992),would likely cause more rapid rates of heat accumu-lation and hence the more rapid onset of fatigue dur-ing prolonged exercise. This ﬁnding alone could ex-plain why the best marathon runners usually haveVO\\n2max values in the range of 63–74 ml/kg/min.\\nLess economical runners with higher VO 2max values\\n(Noakes 1988) have not necessarily been more suc-cessful (Noakes et al. 1990, Noakes 1992).\\nThus, this model predicts that success in endurance\\nFig. 11.

Hence changes in running economy with trainingallow athletes to run faster and at a lower exercise intensity, the\\nopposite of what is usually assumed.\\n140events is not likely to result from training that makes\\nthe athlete ever more powerful with a larger musclemass and greater VO\\n2max. A more likely adaptation\\nwould be to reduce the athlete’s size and increase hisor her running efﬁciency. That runners believe theyrun better when lighter, is well known.\\nAnother African analogy for this prediction is pro-\\nvided by the physiological strategy that the cheetahhas evolved to survive as a successful predator. Thecheetah, whose chase is terminated by an elevatedrectal temperature after running at up to 100 km Áh\\n»1\\nfor less than a minute (Taylor & Rowntree 1973), suc-\\nceeds because of the animal’s small size and probablya high degree of running economy (due to elasticityprovided by the ﬂexible spine). Thus, laboratory ex-periments showed that when the cheetah’s rectal tem-perature reached 40.5–41 ¾C, ‘‘the cheetahs refused to\\nrun ... They would simply turn over with their feet inthe air and slide on the tread(mill) surface’’ (Taylor &Rowntree 1973).\\nThe small size of the cheetah and its likely high\\nrunning economy slows its rate of heat accumulationjust sufﬁciently for it to outrun the smaller gazelles(·25 kg) on which it preys and whose escape is also\\nrestrained by a rising body temperature (Taylor & Ly-man 1972). Thus the chase between the gazelle andthe cheetah is probably decided by which individualanimal accumulates heat more slowly during thechase. In contrast, the heavier, more muscular lionhas evolved a different co-operative, hunting strategy,targeting larger but slower mammals.\\nPerhaps the point is that smallness and greater run-\\nning economy would seem to be a technique used toincrease endurance capacity in one animal, the chee-tah. Logic suggests that this technique may also beapplicable to elite human athletes.\\nA second component of the biomechanical models\\nstems from the accumulating evidence that repeatedhigh velocity, short duration eccentric muscle con-tractions, as occur during running, induce a speciﬁcform of fatigue that develops during running racesand is measurable for at least 7 days after a marathonrace (Komi & Nicol 1998; Nicol et al. 1991).\\nCharacteristics of this fatigue are a failure of the\\ncontractile capacity of the exercised muscles with areduced tolerance to muscle stretch and a delayedtransfer from muscle stretch to muscle shortening inthe stretch/shortening cycle. As a result, the durationsof both the braking and push-off phases in the run-ning stride are increased, leading to mechanicalchanges in the stride with landing occurring on amore extended leg but with greater subsequent kneeﬂexion.\\nAs these abnormalities persist for many days after\\nthe race (Fig. 12), they cannot be explained by acutechanges in oxygen or substrate delivery to themuscles, or by the elevated body temperature during'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nexercise, as required by the ﬁrst 3 models. Rather,\\nKomi and Nicol (1998) conclude that: ‘‘Stretch short-ening fatigue results usually in a reversible muscledamage process and has considerable inﬂuence onmuscle mechanics, joint and muscle stiffness as wellas on reﬂex intervention’’. Thus any evaluation of fa-tigue resistance, especially in weight-bearing activitieslike running, needs to consider this speciﬁc form ofstretch/shortening cycle fatigue.\\nT o return to the African analogy, empirical obser-\\nvation of the running stride and the anatomical struc-ture of the lower limb of Kenyan runners suggests, atleast to this author, that an evaluation of the elasticelements of the legs of elite Kenyan runners and theirresistance to stretch/shortening cycle fatigue wouldlikely be very rewarding.\\nFor example, it appears that African athletes gen-\\nerally train harder than do Caucasian runners (Tans-er 1997, Coetzer et al. 1993). Especially the trainingvolumes and intensities of the Kenyan runners (Tans-er 1997) are unmatched by other athletes. But toachieve such training volumes, there must be superiorresistance to the stretch/shortening cycle damage pro-posed by Komi & Nicol (1998), both in training andin marathon racing.\\nHence, another possibility is that the more elastic\\nmuscles of elite distance runners are better able toresist eccentrically induced damage in training. Thismay allow more intensive daily training and hencesuperior adaptations to training. That same superior-ity would also enhance performance during competi-tive racing by delaying the onset of the stretch/short-ening cycle fatigue that is an inevitable consequenceof repeated eccentric muscle contractions.\\nIn summary, the biomechanical model predicts that\\nsuperior performance, especially in a weight-bearingactivity like running, may be inﬂuenced by the ca-pacity of the muscles to act as elastic energy returnsystems. Changes in the efﬁciency and durability ofthis process would (i) enhance movement economyand reduce the rate of heat production during exer-cise, thereby enhancing exercise capacity by slowingthe rate at which the body temperature rises whenenvironmental conditions are severe; (ii) enhance thequality of training by allowing more rapid recoveryfrom stretch/shortening cycle fatigue so that morefrequent bouts of intensive training can be under-taken and (iii) enhance fatigue resistance during com-petition by increasing resistance to that form ofmuscle damage that develops during repeated cyclesof stretch/shortening contractions.\\nThe psychological/motivational model\\nThis model holds that the ability to sustain exercise\\nperformance results from a conscious effort and isoften included as a component of the central fatigue\\n141\\nFig. 12. According to the Biomechanical Model of Exercise\\nPhysiology and Athletic Performance, repetitive eccentricmuscle contractions, as occurs in the quadriceps and calfmuscles during running, produces altered muscle function witha loss of elastic energy production, requiring an increased workduring the push-off phase of the running stride. The studies ofKomi & Nicol (1998) and Nicol et al. (1991) show that there is apersistent reduction in peak torque and endurance performancetime of the quadriceps muscle of subjects after they completeda 42.2 km marathon race. Integrated electromyographic activity(IEMG) in both the vastus medialis (VM) and the vastus lat-eralis (VL) was also reduced after the marathon. These studiesshow that there is a long-term effect of marathon running onskeletal muscle performance that persists after the muscle’s en-ergy stores are replaced, indicating that this abnormality is notexplained by the Energy Depletion Model. It seems probablethat the marathon ‘‘wall’’ (Noakes 1992) is probably explainedby these alterations in skeletal muscle function.\\nhypothesis (Davis & Bailey1997). But it conﬂicts with\\none proposal of the muscle recruitment model, whichholds that exercise performance is regulated at a sub-conscious level and which exists, in part, to preventconscious override that might damage the human.\\nIt would seem that exercise performance must in-\\nclude at least some component that can be inﬂuencedby conscious effort. The dichotomy of physiologyand psychology has generally prevented adequate lab-oratory evaluation of this model. Any studies show-ing an ergogenic effect of any placebo interventionon exercise performance would prove that this modelcontributes, in part, to athletic performance. Any de-tailed discussion of this model is beyond the scope ofthis author’s expertise.\\nSummary\\nThis paper has reviewed some of the models currently\\npromoted to describe how exercise performance islimited by fatigue and enhanced by training. The ar-gument advanced here is that until the factors deter-mining both fatigue and athletic performance are es-tablished more deﬁnitely, it remains difﬁcult to deﬁnewhich training adaptations are the most importantfor enhancing exercise performance, or how training'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='Noakes\\nshould be structured to maximize those adaptations.\\nThis remains a serious weakness for the practical ap-plication of much research in the exercise sciences.\\nHowever, within the constraints provided by these\\nmodels, it would seem that the following training ad-aptations would contribute to enhanced exercise per-formance with training.(a)Cardiovascular/neural recruitment model : Rel-\\nevant training adaptations would be those thatresult in an increased VO\\n2max and skeletal\\nmuscle blood ﬂow during both maximal and pro-longed submaximal exercise.\\nAccording to the model I have presented here,\\na plateau in coronary ﬂow would appear to bethe factor that limits the cardiac output, andhence the VO\\n2max. Thus, an essential compo-\\nnent of training would be to increase the maximalcoronary ﬂow.\\nHowever, even if the maximal coronary blood\\nﬂow limits the maximal cardiac output, the actualpeak workrate or peak VO\\n2max that is achieved\\nwill depend on the contractile state of the myo-cardium and the efﬁciency with which the heartis able to convert that maximum coronary ﬂowinto a peak cardiac output. Similarly, the actualmaximum work of which the muscles are capableat the VO\\n2max, will equally depend on the econ-\\nomy and contractility of the skeletal muscles.Thus, optimum training would not only maxim-ize coronary ﬂow but also the efﬁciency and con-tractility of both the heart and skeletal muscles.\\nIncidentally, according to this model, inter-\\nventions such as EPO therapy, blood re-infusion,or the administration of oxygen, all of which im-prove performance, would act in part by increas-ing oxygenation of the myocardium at maximalexercise, thereby allowing a greater cardiac outputand hence a higher VO\\n2max.\\n(b)Energy supply model : The important training ad-\\naptation would be an increased capacity to storeand utilize metabolic substrates during exercisewith a greater capacity to produce ATP and pre-vent a reduction in muscle phosphagen concen-trations under all exercise conditions. Adap-tations in different metabolic pathways would benecessary for optimizing performance in activi-ties of different durations and intensities.\\n(c)Energy depletion model : A reduced rate of carbo-\\nhydrate utilization during prolonged exercisewould enhance performance by delaying the on-set of whole body carbohydrate depletion. Thismodel predicts that an increased capacity to burnfat during prolonged exercise would enhance en-durance performance. That this model can also\\n142be considered as an ‘‘energy supply’’ model wasdescribed above.\\n(d)Muscle recruitment and muscle power models :\\nThese models predict that increased skeletalmuscle contractile function, a peripheral effect,or increased neural recruitment, a central nervoussystem effect, would be advantageous for per-formance during exercise.\\n(e)The biomechanical model : A key predictor of the\\nbiomechanical model is that increased movementeconomy would improve performance by reduc-ing the rate of heat accumulation during exercise.This model also explains why a reduced bodymass would improve performance during pro-longed exercise as it slows the rate of heat ac-cumulation.\\nThe importance of elastic return energy, espe-\\ncially in weight-bearing sports, and the identiﬁ-cation of stretch/shortening cycle fatigue suggeststhat training may improve elasticity and delaystretch/shortening cycle fatigue, perhaps by al-tering the elastic component of skeletal muscle,tendons and ligaments.\\nConclusion\\nThe importance of these conceptual models is that they\\nindicate that different physiological systems may de-termine performance under different exercise con-ditions. Hence, exercise physiologists need to considerall these models when they design studies to determinewhich are the most important physiological, biochem-ical, neural and other factors determining the changesin exercise performance that result from training.\\nMore importantly, this review shows that many\\nﬁndings are incompatible with the predictions of oneor more of these models. Rather than simply continu-ing to accept these inconsistencies uncritically, themodern generation of exercise physiologists shouldchallenge old dogmas and so approach more closelythe unattainable truth (Noakes 1997, 1998).\\nKey words: fatigue; VO\\n2max; heart; skeletal muscle;\\nglycogen; fat metabolism; muscle recruitment; con-tractility.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe author’s research is funded by the dedicated ﬁnancial sup-\\nport of the University of Cape T own, the Medical ResearchCouncil of South Africa, the Liberty Life Insurance Company,the Foundation for Research and Development, the FoundingDonors of the Sports Science Institute of South Africa, BromorFoods, and a variety of nutritional and pharmaceutical com-panies.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nReferences\\nAcevedo EO, Goldfarb AH.

But this car-diovascular/anaerobic model is unsatisfactory because (i)a more rigorous analysis indicates that the ﬁrst organ tobe affected by anaerobiosis during maximal exercisewould likely be the heart, not the skeletal muscles. Thisprobability was fully appreciated by the pioneering exer-cise physiologists, A. V . Hill, A. Bock and D. B.

If sportsperformance cannot be measured frequently with ahigh degree of precision in the laboratory, then train-ing-induced changes in exercise performance are notquantiﬁable. As a result, most studies use physiologi-cal surrogates to predict changes in exercise perform-ance. The most widely used performance surrogate isthe maximum oxygen consumption (VO\\n2max). But,\\nthe very use of this speciﬁc measure has helped toentrench a particular and, perhaps, unquestioningdogma of the factors that likely determine human ex-ercise performance (Noakes 1988, 1997, 1998).\\nAs a result, most of the training studies reported\\nin the literature have measured the physiological andbiochemical responses of the human to training andhave paid less attention (i) to the extent to which hu-man exercise performance is altered by differenttraining programmes and (ii) to the speciﬁc physio-logical adaptations which explain training-inducedchanges in athletic performance.\\nIndeed, an important weakness in our current\\nthinking in exercise physiology is that we lack certainknowledge of the precise factors that determine fa-tigue and hence limit performance in different typesof exercise under a range of environmental con-ditions. In part, this is because some scientists remainunaware that their research is based on the (subcon-scious) acceptance usually of one speciﬁc model ofhuman exercise physiology (Noakes 1997, 1998).

Thisinformation is freely available, largely descriptive andnot particularly contentious, so that its review is un-likely to challenge how we think about our science.Rather I will use this opportunity to pose two ques-tions: What physiological models have exercise scien-tists developed (and subconsciously accepted) for thestudy of the physiological and biochemical determi-nants of fatigue during exercise?

Each modelhas its own proponents, usually those with a specialexpertise in the speciﬁc areas embraced by the model.Thus, the cardiovascular/anaerobic model is pro-moted usually by cardiovascular and respiratoryphysiologists; the energy supply/energy depletionmodel is favoured by the exercise biochemists; themuscle power/muscle recruitment model is advocatedby muscle physiologists, and some biomechanists andneuro-physiologists; the biomechanical model by bio-mechanists, and the psychological/motivationalmodel by sports psychologists.\\nY et it is highly improbable that the factors explain-\\ning human exercise performance under all conditionsare restricted to one physiological system or to onescientiﬁc discipline. Thus, human performance is un-likely to be adequately deﬁned by any of these uni-tary models that are often presented as if they aremutually exclusive. The complexity of the physiologi-cal and other factors determining human perform-ance is emphasized when the limitations of each ofthese models are exposed.\\nThe cardiovascular/anaerobic model\\nMaximal exercise\\nThis model holds that endurance performance is de-termined by the capacity of the athlete’s large heartto pump unusually large volumes of blood and oxy-gen to the muscles. This allows the muscles to achievehigher work rates before they outstrip the availableoxygen supply, developing skeletal muscle anaerobi-osis (Fig. 1) (Noakes 1988, 1997, 1998, Bassett &Howley 1997). This model remains the most popularfor explaining why fatigue develops during exercise;how the body adapts to training; how these adap-tations enhance performance and, as a consequence,how effective exercise training programmes should bestructured.\\nThis model predicts that training increases ‘‘cardio-\\nvascular ﬁtness’’ especially by increasing the body’smaximum capacity to consume oxygen, measured asthe maximum oxygen consumption (VO\\n2max).

The Cardiovascular/Anaerobic Model of Exercise Physi-\\nology and Athletic Performance holds that the heart has a limit-ing maximum cardiac output that is reached at the onset of a‘‘plateau phenomenon’’, ascribed incorrectly to the work of Hilland colleagues (Hill et al. 1924, Hill 1927). As a result, bloodand hence oxygen ﬂow to the exercising muscles falls behinddemand, inducing anaerobic metabolism. Metabolites of anaer-obic metabolism, in particular hydrogen ions, then inhibitmuscle contraction, inducing fatigue.\\noxygen, the latter by increasing skeletal muscle capil-\\nlarization and mitochondrial mass. It is argued thatthese adaptations delay the onset of skeletal muscleanaerobiosis during vigorous exercise, thereby reduc-ing blood lactate concentrations in muscle and bloodat all exercise intensities above the so-called ‘‘anaer-obic threshold’’. The delayed onset of this blood lac-tate accumulation then allows the exercising musclesto continue contracting for longer at higher intensit-ies before the onset of fatigue.\\nIn addition, these changes increase the capacity of\\nthe muscles to use fat as a fuel during exercise, there-by enhancing endurance performance (according tothe Energy Depletion model, described subsequently)(Saltin & Gollnick 1983, Holloszy & Coyle 1984). Animportant but unrecognized prediction of this modelis that increases in coronary blood ﬂow must be anessential adaptation to training (Noakes 1998). Thehigher coronary blood ﬂow allows a greater pumpingcapacity of the heart producing a greater cardiac out-put to perfuse the exercising muscles, which can thenachieve a higher exercise capacity.\\nThis model ﬁnds strong support from the conﬁr-\\nmation that these changes, with the exception of agreater coronary ﬂow which is inferred, not proven,do indeed result from training, as fully documentedin the literature. The key question is whether thesechanges are causally linked; that is, do these changescause the change in exercise performance or do theyoccur pari-passu with other adaptation(s) that are thereal cause of changes in exercise performance. Forthere are important deﬁciencies in this model whichare fully argued (Noakes 1988, 1997) and counter-argued (Noakes 1998, Bassett & Howley 1997) else-where and will not be repeated here.\\n125Perhaps the major but overlooked limitation of this\\nmodel is that, if the pumping capacity of the heartdoes indeed limit oxygen utilization by the exercisingskeletal muscle, then the heart itself will be the ﬁrstorgan affected by any postulated oxygen deﬁciency(Noakes 1998). This was ﬁrst recognized by Hill andhis colleagues as early as 1925 (Hill et al. 1924). Para-doxically it was the incorrect interpretation, byothers, of the work of Hill and his colleagues, in par-ticular their supposed description of a plateau phe-nomenon (Noakes 1998), that forms the (mythical)foundation for the cardiovascular/anaerobic model ofexercise physiology.

But, unlike skeletal muscle, the heartis dependent for its blood supply on its own pumpingcapacity. Hence any intervention that reduces thepumping capacity of the heart, or demands the heartsomehow to sustain an increased work output by theexercising muscles without any increase in cardiacoutput and coronary ﬂow (as theoretically occurswhen the ‘‘plateau phenomenon’’ develops), imperilsthe heart’s own blood supply. Any reduction in coro-nary blood ﬂow will consequently reduce the heart’spumping capacity, thereby inducing a vicious cycle ofprogressive and irreversible myocardial ischaemia(Fig. 2). It would seem logical that human designshould include controls to protect the heart from everentering this vicious circle.\\nHence if (skeletal) muscle function fails when its\\noxygen demand exceeds supply then, for logical con-sistency, the inability of the pumping capacity of theheart to ‘‘raise the cardiac output’’ at the VO\\n2max\\n(Rowell 1993), must also result from an inadequate(myocardial) oxygen supply caused by a plateau in\\nFig. 3. According to the logic of the Cardiovascular/Anaerobic\\nModel of Exercise Physiology and Athletic Performance, coro-nary ﬂow must be the ﬁrst physiological variable to ‘‘plateau’’during progressive exercise to exhaustion. The peak in coronaryﬂow would then induce a plateau in cardiac output as a resultof a progressive myocardial ischaemia. Continuing to exercisewith a ﬁxed cardiac output and coronary ﬂow would rapidlycause an ischaemia-induced fall in cardiac output and in coro-nary ﬂow, and hence in whole body oxygen consumption. Thislogic was accepted by the early proponents of this model (Hillet al. 1924, Bainbridge 1931, Hill 1927, Dill 1938) but has sincebeen overlooked by exercise physiologists for the past 75 years.\\n126coronary ﬂow. This limiting coronary blood ﬂow in-\\nduces myocardial ‘‘fatigue’’, causing the plateau incardiac output and hence in the VO\\n2max leading,\\nﬁnally, to skeletal muscle anaerobiosis. Thus, by thislogic, the coronary blood ﬂow must be the ﬁrstphysiological function to show a ‘‘plateau phenom-enon’’ during progressive exercise to exhaustion (Fig.3). All subsequent physiological ‘‘plateaus’’ must re-sult from this limiting coronary ﬂow (Noakes 1998).\\nWhereas the most inﬂuential modern exercise\\nphysiologists have enthusiastically embraced thismythical basis for a ‘‘plateau phenomenon’’ for thepast 75 years, none seems to have grasped this logicalprediction of the ‘‘plateau phenomenon’’, which isthat the ‘‘plateau phenomenon’’ requires the heart tofatigue ﬁrst before skeletal muscle fatigue can de-velop. But this was clearly a concept with which thepioneering exercise physiologists were entirelycomfortable. Thus, in addition to the conclusion ofHill and his colleagues, already quoted, both Bockand Dill (Bainbridge 1931) also believed that myocar-dial hypoxia causes a fall in the cardiac output at thepoint of fatigue during high intensity exercise:\\n‘‘The blood supply to the heart, in many men, may\\nbe the weak link in the chain of circulatory adjust-ments during muscular exercise, and as the intensityof muscular exertion increases, a point is probablyreached in most individuals at which the supply ofoxygen to the heart falls short of its demands, andthe continued performance of work becomes difﬁcultor impossible’’ (p. 15). Hence they proposed that:‘‘Another factor, which may contribute to the pro-duction of this type of fatigue, is fatigue of the heartitself ’’ (p. 229).\\n‘‘Although the occurrence of fatigue of the heart\\nin health is not very clearly established, a temporarylowering of the functional capacity of the heart, in-duced by fatigue of its muscular ﬁbres, might gradu-ally bring about during exercise an insufﬁcient bloodsupply to the skeletal muscles and brain. The lassi-tude and disinclination for exertion, often experi-enced on the day after a strenuous bout of exercise,has been ascribed to fatigue of the heart as its pri-mary cause’’ (p. 229). Hence they concluded: ‘‘Theheart, as a rule, reaches the limit of its powers earlierthan the skeletal muscles, and determines a man’scapability for exertion’’.\\nIn summary, the early physiologists who believed\\nthat skeletal muscle anaerobiosis limits maximal exer-cise clearly understood that any plateau in cardiacoutput, necessary for there to be a limiting skeletalmuscle blood ﬂow, must result from a plateau in coro-nary blood ﬂow which would expose the heart to aprogressive myocardial ischaemia that would worsenas exercise was prolonged.\\nPerhaps the reluctance of modern physiologists to\\nacknowledge these concepts stems from the current')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='lactate paradox', type='Phenomenon', properties={}), Node(id='Hochachka 1989', type='Person',

ischaemia\\ndoes not occur during maximal exercise in healthyathletes (Raskoff et al. 1976), even though there isgood evidence that it is a limiting cardiac output thatprobably determines the VO\\n2max (Rowell 1993).\\nThus, one postulate might be that even if cardiac out-put limits maximal exercise as seems likely (Noakes1997), termination of exercise must occur before theheart actually reaches that maximum and hence wellbefore skeletal muscle anaerobiosis can develop(Noakes 1998). Hence for 75 years, exercise physiol-ogists may have focused on the incorrect organ as thesite of any potential anaerobiosis that may developduring maximal exercise (Hill et al. 1924, Bainbridge1931, Hill 1927, Hill et al. 1924).\\nHow might a maximal cardiac output be reached\\nwithout the development of myocardial ischaemia?The argument that the rate of cardiac ﬁlling, dueeither to a limiting venous return or the effects of arestrictive pericardium (Stray-Gundersen et al. 1986)may limit the maximal cardiac output, whilst super-ﬁcially attractive, is still unable satisfactorily to ex-plain which physiological events terminates exercise.Such an argument fails for the reason that the con-tinuation of exercise beyond that (however limited)maximal cardiac output must still cause a progressivemyocardial ischaemia to develop (Fig. 2). Hence, evenif the cardiac output is limited by factors unrelatedto the development of myocardial ischaemia (for ex-ample, a limiting venous return), the continuation ofexercise beyond that point of limitation must inducemyocardial ischaemia and the development of chestpain (angina pectoris) that would terminate exercise.\\nPerhaps it is more logical to speculate that maxi-\\nmal exercise terminates as part of a regulated processbefore the absolute maximum cardiac output andcoronary blood ﬂow are achieved. Interestingly Hilland his colleagues seem to have been the ﬁrst to sug-gest a solution to this dilemma as early as 1924:‘‘From the point of view of a well co-ordinated mech-anism, ... it would clearly be useless for the heart tomake an excessive effort if by doing so it merely pro-duced a far lower degree of saturation of the arterialblood; and we suggest that, in the body (either in theheart muscle itself or in the nervous system), there issome mechanism which causes a slowing of the circu-lation as soon as a serious degree of unsaturation oc-curs, and vice versa. This mechanism would tend toact as a governor maintaining a high degree of satu-ration of the blood’’ (Hill et al. 1924, p. 161–162).\\nClearly no such governor has yet been discovered,\\nperhaps because no physiologists have yet searchedfor it. But there is clear physiological evidence for theexistence of such a governor. The evidence comesfrom studies of skeletal and cardiac muscle functionat altitude. For if oxygen deﬁciency really does de-velop in either heart or skeletal muscle during maxi-\\n127mum exercise, its appearance will likely be more eas-ily identiﬁable during exercise at altitude under con-ditions of hypobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, suchexperiments should identify in which organ – heartor skeletal muscle – anaerobiosis ﬁrst becomes ap-parent; the heart, according to the ideas of the pion-eering British and North American exercise physiol-ogists, or the skeletal muscles, according to the inﬂu-ential group of modern exercise physiologists(Noakes 1998).\\nThe original studies of exercise at altitude were\\nundertaken by a research group co-ordinated by Dilland his colleagues from the Harvard fatigue labora-tory. This research established two crucial ﬁndings.First, that peak blood lactate concentrations duringmaximum exercise fell with increasing altitude (Ed-wards 1936), a phenomenon since labelled the ‘‘lac-tate paradox’’ (Hochachka 1989). Second, that maxi-mum heart rate and cardiac output likewise fell dur-ing exercise at increasing altitude (Christensen 1938,Dill 1938).\\nEdwards (1936) interpreted the ‘‘lactate paradox’’\\nat altitude accordingly: ‘‘The inability to accumulatelarge amounts of lactate at high altitudes suggests aprotective mechanism preventing an already low ar-terial saturation from becoming markedly lower ... Itmay be that the protective mechanism lies in an inad-equate oxygen supply to essential muscles, e.g. thediaphragm or the muscles’’.\\nThe existence of the ‘‘lactate paradox’’ was con-\\nﬁrmed during the epic laboratory experiment of exer-cise and acclimatization at simulated high altitude,Operation Everest II (Green et al. 1989). That studyfound that muscle lactate concentrations achievedduring maximal exercise at the highest equivalent alti-tude achieved during that experiment (8848 m –equivalent to the summit of Mount Everest) were nohigher than when at rest at sea level.\\nHence, in as much as high muscle lactate concen-\\ntrations would have to be present if the exercisingmuscles were contracting ‘‘anaerobically’’, this studyproves that exercise at extreme altitude terminateswhen the exercising muscles are contracting in fullyaerobic conditions.\\nSimilarly Operation Everest II (Sutton et al. 1988)\\nconﬁrmed these original and subsequent studies(Pugh 1964, V ogel et al. 1974) showing that heart rateand cardiac output are substantially reduced duringexercise at extreme altitude. The key observation isthat the peak cardiac output falls with increasing alti-tude. This response is equally paradoxical for thosewho believe that the delivery of an adequate oxygensupply to the exercising muscles is the cardinal prior-ity during exercise (Noakes 1998). For logic demandsthat ifthe principal responsibility of the cardiovascu-\\nlar system during exercise is the achievement of an(ultimately inadequate) oxygen supply to skeletal')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='A.V.

The heart\\nmakes the exactly opposite adjustment – maximumcardiac output falls with increasing altitude (Suttonet al. 1988). The reduction is due to the reduction inheart rate; stroke volume and myocardial contrac-tility are, if anything, enhanced during peak exerciseat altitude (Reeves et al. 1987, Suarez et al. 1987).Hence the conclusion must be that some currentlyunrecognized mechanism must exist to insure that theheart does not become ‘‘anaerobic’’ during maximalexercise at any altitude – from sea level to the summitof Mount Everest – in healthy humans.\\nInterestingly Christensen, but not Dill, interpreted\\nthis phenomenon correctly: ‘‘Christensen and I dif-fered in our interpretation of his measurements ofrespiratory and circulatory function in exercise (ataltitude). In his opinion, the chief limiting factor isthe ventilation of the lungs. In the hardest grade ofwork at any station, the pulmonary ventilationreached about as high a value as at sea level, while themaximal cardiac output became less as the altitudeincreased. He thinks this means that the heart has anuntapped reserve; it is circulating blood fast enoughto carry to the tissues all the oxygen supplied by thelungs’’ (Dill 1938, p. 170–171).\\nThese studies invite two precise conclusions. First,\\nthat the oxygen demands of the skeletal muscles arenot the cardinal priority and hence are not ‘‘pro-tected’’ during maximum exercise, at least at extremealtitude. Second, neither the skeletal muscles nor theheart becomes ‘‘anaerobic’’ during maximal exercise\\nFig. 4. The ‘‘governor’’ postulated by Hill could be activated by\\na limiting myocardial oxygen delivery. As a result, there wouldbe a reduced activation of the exercising skeletal muscle by thecerebral motor cortex. There is compelling evidence for thepresence of this reﬂex during exercise at altitude (Kayser et al.1994) with the result that neither the heart (Sutton et al. 1988,Reeves et al. 1987, Suzrez et al. 1987) nor the skeletal muscles(Green et al. 1989) develop ‘‘anaerobiosis’’ during maximal ex-ercise at extreme altitude.\\n128under conditions of hypobaric hypoxia. The sole con-\\nclusion must be that some type of ‘‘governor’’, asoriginally proposed by A.V . Hill, must limit maxi-mum exercise at altitude. Furthermore, it would bedifﬁcult to explain why the same control mechanismshould not act similarly during maximum exercise atsea level.\\nIn summary, a number of famous studies have\\nshown that under the precise conditions likely to in-duce anaerobiosis in either the heart or skeletalmuscles – maximal exercise at altitude – neither theheart nor the skeletal muscle show any evidencewhatsoever for ‘‘anaerobic’’ metabolism. This unex-pected ﬁnding can be explained only if there is a‘‘governor’’, probably in the central nervous system,whose function is likely to prevent the developmentof myocardial ischaemia. The same governor couldalso serve the identical function also at sea level,thereby preventing the development of myocardialischaemia during maximum exercise at sea level, ac-cording to Fig. 2. As Dill (1938) concluded, probablycorrectly: ‘‘The capacity of the heart, as has alreadybeen suggested, is restricted at high altitude becauseof the deﬁciency in supply of oxygen to it’’ (p. 15).But the important point is that the heart never actu-ally develops an oxygen deﬁciency at altitude or atsea level; the governor acts to terminate exercise be-fore that deﬁciency becomes apparent.\\nThe ﬁnal conﬁrmation for the presence of this the-\\noretical governor comes from the study of Kayser etal. (1994). They showed that skeletal muscle recruit-ment, measured as skeletal muscle EMG activity atpeak exercise, falls with increasing altitude, but in-creases acutely with oxygen administration. Theyconclude: ‘‘during chronic hypobaric hypoxia, thecentral nervous system may play a primary role inlimiting exhaustive exercise and maximum accumu-lation of lactate in blood’’. This study thereforeproves the existence of the neural effector limb ofHill’s postulated governor (Fig. 4) and its activityduring exercise at altitude.\\nInterestingly, had the human body been designed\\nto function according to the modern physiologists’cardiovascular/anaerobic model, which requires thatanaerobiosis ﬁrst develops in skeletal muscle beforemaximal exercise is terminated, no climber wouldever have reached the summit of Mount Everest orother high mountains, even with the use of sup-plemental oxygen. Rather, all would have succumbedto a combination of myocardial ischaemia and cer-ebral hypoxia whilst their skeletal muscles were exer-cising vigorously and unrestrainedly, in pursuit of an-aerobiosis and fatigue, according to the model de-picted in Fig. 1.\\nFigure 4 therefore summarizes the hypothetical\\nexistence and action of the ‘‘governor’’, ﬁrst proposedby A.V .

venous oxygen ten-sion. Before any of these reach some predeterminedlimit, the motor cortex in the brain reduces skeletalmuscle activation. As a consequence, skeletal musclerecruitment either fails to rise further or it falls, limit-ing the work output of the body, indicating the onsetof ‘‘fatigue’’. The fall in work output by the bodyreduces myocardial oxygen demand and, as a conse-quence, the threat of myocardial ischaemia is averted.\\nAlternatively it may be that myocardial adenosine\\ntriphosphate (ATP) concentrations are sensed and‘‘defended’’ in much the same way as appears to bethe case for skeletal muscle, as discussed subsequently(Fitts 1994, Spriet et al. 1987). Reduction of myocar-dial ATP concentrations could lead directly to a re-duction in myocardial contractile force as occurs in‘‘myocardial stunning’’ (Braunwald & Kloner 1982).This could explain the onset of cardiac failure duringmaximal exercise in persons with coronary artery dis-ease but could not explain why, at altitude, left ven-tricular function is enhanced during maximal exerciseand shows no evidence for ‘‘fatigue’’.\\nAccordingly, it is proposed that maximal exercise is\\nlimited by a regulated process that terminates exercisebefore the development of a progressive myocardialischaemia, that would precede the development ofskeletal muscle anaerobiosis. This model further pre-dicts that peak coronary blood ﬂow is an importantdeterminant of maximum exercise performance, andthat interventions, including exercise training, that in-crease the maximum cardiac output probably also in-crease the maximum coronary blood ﬂow, as theirmore important effect.\\nBut this model does not exclude the possibility that\\ninterventions could also improve exercise perform-ance by altering either skeletal muscle or myocardialcontractile function or the efﬁciency of oxygen util-ization, or both (Fig. 5).\\nInterestingly, the presence of a ‘‘governor’’ prevent-\\ning the development of anaerobiosis in either heartor skeletal muscle during exercise at altitude has in-teresting implications for theories of the value of ex-ercise training at altitude. For its presence means thatany beneﬁcial effect of altitude training cannot resultfrom repeated exposure of either the heart or exercis-ing skeletal muscle to greater levels of ‘‘anaerobiosis’’than can be achieved during maximal exercise at sealevel. This might explain why there remains consider-able controversy about the proven value of high in-tensity training at altitude (Boning 1997).\\nThe additional paradoxes that (i) adaptation to ex-\\ntreme altitude is associated with reduced skeletalmuscle mitochondrial volume and enzyme content(Green et al. 1989, Oelz et al. 1986, Hoppeler et al.1990); (ii) the skeletal muscle morphology of altitude-\\n129\\nFig. 5. According to the Hill/Noakes Cardiovascular/Neural\\nModel of Exercise Physiology and Athletic Performance, per-formance during maximal exercise is ultimately limited by thepeak coronary blood ﬂow. However, the actual workrateachieved at that peak coronary blood ﬂow would be determinedby the efﬁciency and contractility of both the heart and theactive skeletal muscles.\\nadapted Nepalese Sherpas is not different from that\\nof acclimatized Caucasian climbers (Kayser et al.1991) except that (iii) the volume density of skeletalmuscle mitochondria is signiﬁcantly smaller in Sherp-as than in untrained sedentary subjects (Kayser et al.1991), can best be explained if exercise performanceat altitude is more likely determined by factors pro-ducing superior oxygenation of the heart, than of theskeletal muscles. This model therefore predicts thatcoronary blood ﬂow and perhaps cardiac mitochon-drial mass would be higher in high altitude nativesand superior performers at high altitude. This wouldexplain why high altitude natives achieve almost simi-lar cardiac outputs at sea level and at altitude (V ogelet al. 1974), indicating a lesser activation of the ‘‘gov-ernor’’ during exercise at altitude.\\nIndeed the ability of high altitude natives to\\nachieve high heart rates and cardiac outputs duringexercise at altitude is associated with ‘‘relatively highoxygen tension and

An Olympic analogy from my (African)continent highlights the issues that require debate.\\nIn the years since Wilson Kiprugut won Kenya’s\\nﬁrst Olympic medal by ﬁnishing third in the 800 m atthe 1964 Olympic Games, the dominance byAfricans, especially Kenyans, in distance running hasbecome a phenomenon unequalled in any other sportin the world (Bale & Sang 1996, Tanser 1997). T womeasures of that dominance are provided by theworld rankings of male Kenyan track runners in 1996(Tanser 1997) (Table 2) and of the performances ofthe men and women’s team, both senior and junior,in the W orld Cross-Country championships over thepast 12 years (Tanser 1997) (Table 3). Of particularinterest is the almost total dominance of the 3000 msteeplechase by Kenyans (Table 2). Indeed in excessof 90% of the 100 fastest-ever 3000 m steeplechasetimes in the world have been set by Kenyans. Any\\n130physiological explanation for the Kenyan’s successmust be able also to explain why these physiologicalattributes, uniquely common in Kenyan runners, of-fer an even greater advantage in cross-country eventsand in the steeplechase, rather than at other distancesin which repeated jumping and changes in speed donot occur.\\nT wo studies of Kenyan runners failed to provide a\\ndeﬁnitive physiological answer for their manifest su-periority as distance runners although two of the bestKenyan runners were the most efﬁcient runners yetstudied (Saltin 1996, Saltin et al. 1995a,b) (Fig. 6).The overriding conclusion was that the Kenyans’ VO\\n2\\nmax values were not inordinately high; hence, a su-perior capacity for oxygen consumption during maxi-\\nmum exercise did not explain the Kenyans’ manifest\\nsuperiority during more prolonged submaximal exer-\\ncise. In the words of Bengt Saltin, the senior author:‘‘A comparison of some data on some of the verybest runners in Kenya during the last decades andworld class runners in Scandinavia does not revealmuch that was not already known or could be antici-pated’’ (Saltin 1996).\\nThe only other study of elite (South) African dis-\\ntance runners is that of Coetzer et al. (1993). Thatstudy, which reported physiological data in the bestgroup of distance runners yet evaluated anywhere inthe world, has been largely ignored, for reasons thatare not immediately clear. The sole weakness of thestudy was that the physiological characteristics of el-\\nFig. 6. In comparison to a group of elite Scandinavian runners\\n(the highest running curve), the running economy (VO 2at any\\nrunning speed) of former world marathon record holder, DerekClayton, and two of the greatest Kenyan runners, Julius Korirand John Ngugi, is substantially better.

This comparison group wasnot ideal but was necessary because no other readilyavailable group could match the performances of theblack distance runners at any distance over 5 km. Butthe performances of the black and white runners inthat study were at least equal in races of 1–3 km.Table 4 lists the important ﬁndings of that study.\\nThe black distance runners were lighter and\\nsmaller, as also reported by Saltin (1996), with aslightly lower proportion of type I muscle ﬁbres. Butthe key ﬁnding was that the black runners were ableto run substantially faster at all distances beyond 5km despite VO\\n2max values that were the same as\\nthose of the middle distance runners. Hence the car-diovascular/anaerobic model failed to explain the su-perior endurance capacity of the black distance run-ners in that study and perhaps also in the studies ofSaltin and colleagues (Saltin 1996, Saltin et al.1995a,b).\\nRather, the important difference was that the black\\nrunners were able to sustain a substantially higherproportion of their VO\\n2max when racing. This is\\nshown graphically in Fig. 7, which compares the %VO\\n2max sustained by the black and white runners\\nat different racing distances. At distances beyond 5km, black runners sustained a signiﬁcantly higher %VO\\n2max than did the white runners and the differ-\\nence increased with increasing racing distance. Thus,the crucial ﬁnding was that the black distance run-ners have superior fatigue resistance, not a higheraerobic capacity (VO\\n2max). Hence factors distal to\\nthe heart, perhaps in the brain or in the muscles, ap-pear to distinguish the very best runners in the worldfrom those who are almost as good.\\nInterestingly, physiologists have known for at least\\ntwo decades that the % VO\\n2max that athletes can\\nsustain during exercise is an important predictor ofperformance (Costill et al. 1973, Davies & Thompson1979). Y et we have perhaps failed to emphasize, prob-ably because of a devotion to the cardiovascular/an-aerobic model, that this is likely to be a more import-ant determinant of performance in prolonged exer-\\n131cise than is the VO 2max alone. Furthermore, it has\\nnot been appreciated that the % VO 2max sustained\\nduring exercise is a measure of the athlete’s resistanceto fatigue.\\nHence, the important ﬁnding of that study was to\\nshow that the cardiovascular/anaerobic model may beunable to discriminate between very good and su-perior performance in events lasting more than a fewminutes and which constitute the bulk of sportingevents. It is consistent with the ﬁnding that the VO\\n2\\nmax is a relatively poor predictor of endurance per-formance in athletes whose abilities are relativelyhomogenous (Noakes 1988, 1997, 1998, Davies &Thompson 1979, Noakes et al. 1990). The failurestems from the inability of this model to measure orpredict fatigue resistance during prolonged submaxi-\\nmal exercise on the basis of physiological variables\\nand performance measured during a single bout ofprogressive, maximal exercise to exhaustion. Thisconﬁrms that the VO\\n2max test does not measure all\\nthe physiological variables determining success dur-ing more prolonged exercise.\\nFurther support for this explanation can be sur-\\nmised from other information in Fig. 7, which showsthat these athletes run at 100% or greater of theirVO\\n2max in race distances of 1–2 km. Y et it is not at\\nthose distances that the Kenyans’ dominance is mostapparent. If the Kenyans’ success was due to theirunusually high VO\\n2max values, one would expect\\nKenyans also to be dominant at race distances of 800m to the mile, which is not the case (Table 2).\\nIndeed, comparison of the performances of the\\nFig. 7. T h e%V O 2max sustained by elite South African black\\nand white distance runners falls with increasing racing distance.However, black runners sustain a signiﬁcantly higher % VO\\n2\\nmax at race distances of 10 km and 21 km, indicating superiorfatigue resistance. Such superiority cannot be explained by theCardiovascular/Anaerobic Model of Exercise Physiology andAthletic Performance as VO\\n2max values of black and white\\nathletes in this study (Coetzer et al. 1993) were the same.')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='vasodilator capacity increase', type='Phenomenon', properties={}), Node(id='Daniel Komen', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Tim Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Scheuer & Tipton', type='Authors', properties={}), Node(id='A.V.

But any‘‘plateau’’ in cardiac output requires that myocardialischaemia be present either to cause that plateau (ac-cording to the theory that anaerobiosis limits musclefunction) or as a result of it, as the cardiac outputdetermines both coronary and skeletal muscle bloodﬂow. As myocardial ischaemia has never been shownto develop during maximal exercise in healthyhumans, so it would seem unlikely that skeletalmuscle anaerobiosis can develop during progressiveexercise to exhaustion (Noakes 1998). Rather, itwould seem that ‘‘fatigue’’ during maximal exerciseof short duration is part of a regulated neural processthat prevents the development of myocardial isch-aemia during maximal exercise.\\nWhilst this mechanism is designed to protect the\\nheart from myocardial ischaemia, only indirectly doesit determine the actual peak work rate achieved dur-ing maximal exercise (Fig. 5). The actual peak work-rate achieved will depend on the ‘‘quality’’ of the skel-etal and cardiac muscle. Superior myocardial contrac-tility and efﬁciency of oxygen use would increase themaximum cardiac output achieved at any maximum(limiting) coronary ﬂow. Similarly at any maximumskeletal muscle blood ﬂow, superior contractility andefﬁciency of skeletal muscle contraction would in-crease the peak workrate achieved at that maximumcardiac output. This hypothesis forms what might becalled the Cardiovascular/Neural Recruitment Modelof Exercise Physiology and Athletic Performance.\\nThus, this analysis of the traditional cardiovascu-\\nlar/anaerobic model of exercise performance leads tothe alternate hypothesis that superior fatigue resis-tance, determined perhaps by the central nervous sys-tem or skeletal muscle contractile function, might ex-plain superior performance in events lasting morethan a few minutes. This superior fatigue resistancecannot be predicted by the cardiovascular/anaerobicmodel which uses exercise tests of short duration andin which the fatigue resistance component of endur-ance performance is not measured. By extension, itwould seem that fatigue resistance is not causally de-termined by the magnitude of the athlete’s cardio-vascular capacity. There is also no logical reason tobelieve that fatigue resistance during submaximal ex-\\n132ercise is determined by either the presence or absence\\nof skeletal muscle anaerobiosis.\\nAccordingly, changes in exercise performance that\\nresult from endurance training are unlikely to be de-termined solely by changes in cardiovascular func-tion, with the exception that increases in maximumcoronary blood ﬂow would likely be crucial for anyincreases in maximal cardiac output and hence inVO\\n2max. It is of interest that the vasodilator ca-\\npacity of the major epicardial coronary vessel isgreatly increased in veteran long distance runners(Haskell et al. 1993). Perhaps this indicates that animportant effect of endurance training, possibly atsome critical growth periods, may be to increasemaximum coronary blood ﬂow as shown in animalmodels (Scheuer & Tipton 1997).\\nThe energy supply/energy depletion model\\nThe energy supply model\\nThe central premise in the cardiovascular/anaerobicmodel is that it is the provision of a substrate (oxy-gen) to muscle that limits exercise performance sothat fatigue is a direct consequence of a failure ofoxygen delivery to the exercising muscles. A subtleextension of this idea produces a second model whichproposes that fatigue during high intensity exercisemay, alternatively, result from the inability to supplyanother substrate (ATP) at rates sufﬁciently fast tosustain exercise. Nobel Laureate A. V . Hill, whose re-search in the 1920s was directly responsible for thedevelopment of the cardiovascular/anaerobic modelof exercise performance, also wrote: ‘‘The fact re-mains, however, that the chief factor in many formsof athletic achievement is the supply of energy andits proper and economic utilization’’ (Hill 1927, p.237). Dr Peter Snell, Olympic Gold medallist in the800 and 1500 m and former world record holder hasstated similarly: ‘‘Performance in middle and (long)distance running ultimately depends upon the run-ner’s capacity to produce energy for the duration ofthe event, and on the efﬁciency with which that en-ergy is translated to running velocity. Thus the pur-pose of training is to improve the energy delivery sys-tems, according to the demands of the event and toimprove running economy’’ (Snell 1997).\\nThus, this model predicts that performance in\\nevents of different durations is determined by the ca-pacity to produce energy (ATP) by the different meta-bolic pathways including the phosphagens, oxygen-independent glycolysis, aerobic glycolysis and aerobiclipolysis. Superior performance is then explained bya greater capacity to generate ATP in the speciﬁcmetabolic pathway(s) that predominates during thatactivity. Thus, the sprinter is assumed to have agreater capacity to generate ATP from the intramus-cular phosphagen stores and from oxygen-indepen-')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='the high energy phosphates do not participate in the fatigue process', type='Conclusion', properties={}), Node(id='cardiovascular/anaerobic model', type='Model', properties={}), Node(id='Fitts', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='high anaerobic glycolytic ATP production produces metabolites causing fatigue', type='Hypothesis', properties={}), Node(id='oxidize fat (aerobic lipolysis)', type='Characteristic', properties={}), Node(id='Spriet et al.', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='study evaluating skeletal muscle fatigue hypothesis', type='Study', properties={}), Node(id='considerable interindividual differences in pH sensitivities', type='Finding', properties={}), Node(id='ultramarathon runner', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Hill and his colleagues', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='peripheral governor', type='Concept', properties={}), Node(id='Mannion et al.', type='Person', properties={})], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='ultramarathon runner', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='oxidize fat (aerobic lipolysis)', type='Characteristic', properties={}), type='HAS_CAPACITY', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Fitts', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='the high energy phosphates do not participate in the fatigue process', type='Conclusion', properties={}), type='CONCLUDED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Spriet et al.', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='peripheral governor', type='Concept', properties={}), type='IDENTIFIED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='peripheral governor', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='cardiovascular/anaerobic model', type='Model', properties={}), type='ESSENTIAL_COMPONENT_OF', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Hill and his colleagues', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='cardiovascular/anaerobic model', type='Model', properties={}), type='CONCEIVED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='cardiovascular/anaerobic model', type='Model', properties={}), target=Node(id='high anaerobic glycolytic ATP production produces metabolites causing fatigue', type='Hypothesis', properties={}), type='HOLDS', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Mannion et al.', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='study evaluating skeletal muscle fatigue hypothesis', type='Study', properties={}), type='CONDUCTED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Mannion et al.', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='considerable interindividual differences in pH sensitivities', type='Finding', properties={}), type='FOUND', properties={})], source=Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 10, 'id': 'eba83c311d10e1fa9ca7ee7485b68003'}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\ndent glycolysis, whereas the ultramarathon runner\\nhas a superior capacity to oxidize fat (aerobic lipoly-sis) (Hawley & Hopkins 1995).\\nWhether this hypothesis is true is uncertain as it\\nhas yet to be systematically evaluated.

Until thesestudies are completed, this model remains hypotheti-cal, but interesting. It must be remembered that thetruth of this model would need to disprove the op-posing model, described in the previous section,which holds that maximal exercise performance is aregulated process limited by a failure of central neuralrecruitment. Fatigue at exhaustion, caused by a fail-ure of central recruitment, will always appear to be\\ndue to a failure of ATP production unless the alter-nate possibility is studied (and excluded) simul-taneously.\\nThe argument against this model has been intro-\\nduced elsewhere (Noakes 1997). In short, the predic-tion of this model is that exercise must terminatewhen muscle ATP depletion occurs (Fitts 1994), thatis when the muscle develops rigor. Y et here again, theevidence appears clear. ATP concentrations, even inmuscles forced to contract under ischaemic con-ditions, do not drop below about 60% of restingvalues (Fitts 1994, Spriet et al. 1987, Hochachka1994) indicating that muscle ATP concentrations are‘‘defended’’ in order to prevent the development ofskeletal muscle rigor. As Fitts (1994) has concluded:‘‘The overriding evidence suggests that (the high en-ergy phosphates) do not participate in the fatigueprocess; that fatigue produced by other factors re-duces the ATP utilization rate before ATP becomeslimiting. The most compelling evidence for this con-clusion is that cell ATP rarely falls below 70% of thepre-exercise level, even in cases of exercise fatigue’’ (p.82).\\nHence, is appears that the rate of ATP demand by\\nthe contracting muscles can never exceed the maxi-mum rate of ATP supply because of the closematching of ATP demand to the available ATP sup-ply (Spriet et al. 1987, Hochachka 1994).\\nThere is an obvious analogy to the centrally situ-\\nated neural ‘‘governor’’ that prevents the develop-ment of myocardial ischaemia during maximal exer-cise at either sea level or altitude. The difference isthat the ‘‘governor’’ identiﬁed by Spriet et al. (1987)is clearly located in the periphery and acts even inmuscles stimulated to contract with an externally ap-plied current.\\n133It is of interest that the presence of this peripheral\\n‘‘governor’’ is an essential component of the cardio-vascular/anaerobic model as originally conceivedfrom the work of Hill and his colleagues, and stillwidely promoted (Fig. 1). This hypothesis holds thatwhen the rate of ATP production by oxidative sourcesbecomes inadequate, high rates of ‘‘anaerobic’’ glyco-lytic ATP production produce metabolites, particu-larly H\\n¹, which interfere with energy production and\\ncross-bridge cycling causing fatigue and a failure ofmuscle contraction (Fitts 1994). In this way, musclecontraction fails not because of a failure of centralrecruitment (as predicted by the Cardiovascular/Neu-ral Recruitment Model – previous section), but be-cause of a peripherally located inhibition of muscularcontraction. Proponents of this model can cite a largebody of evidence showing that a number of metabo-lites can interfere with muscle cross-bridge cyclingmeasured in vitro in isolated muscle ﬁbres (Fitts\\n1994). The necessary assumption is that skeletalmuscle contracting in vitro in the absence of an intact\\nneural system behaves exactly as it would in vivo\\nwhen the inﬂuences from the central nervous systemare intact. But there is a body of evidence that is notcompatible with these assumptions and conclusions.\\nFor example, one of the few studies to evaluate\\ncritically this hypothesis that metabolites, particu-larly H\\n¹, can induce skeletal muscle fatigue, is that\\nof Mannion et al. (1995). They found that there is awide range of muscle pH concentrations reached atexhaustion during intense exercise showing that if anaccumulation of H\\n¹limits high intensity exercise in\\nvivo, then ‘‘considerable interindividual differences\\nmust exist in the pH sensitivities of the various pro-cesses involved’’ (Mannion et al. 1995, p. 98).\\nNext, they found that in contrast to the prediction\\nfrom in vitro studies, subjects with the highest pro-\\nportion of type II muscle ﬁbres were able to exerciseto the lowest muscle pH concentrations. In contrast,in vitro studies have suggested that type I muscle\\nﬁbres are more resistant to acidosis than are type IIﬁbres. Finally, the authors found that subjects witha greater skeletal muscle buffering capacity did notaccumulate more lactate during maximal exercise;nor were they able to exercise for longer than didthose with lesser muscle buffering capacity. They con-cluded that ‘‘if acidosis makes any contribution to thefatigue during performance of this (high intensity)type of exercise, it is an indirect one ... ’’.\\nOne possibility is that such exercise is terminated\\nby a central governor responding to factors otherthan skeletal muscle pH. Under these circumstancesthere would be no relationship between the onset offatigue and muscle acidosis. This would not negatethe established ﬁnding that in vivo , acidosis inhibits\\ncrossbridge cycling (Fitts 1994).

The ﬁndings that supportthis conclusion are (i) that fatigue during prolongedexercise is associated with depletion of liver (causing\\nhypoglycaemia) or muscle glycogen stores (Fitts 1994,Bosch et al. 1993, Coggan & Coyle 1987, Coyle et al.1986, Tsintzas et al. 1996), or both; (ii) that reversalof hypoglycaemia allows exercise to continue(Coggan & Coyle 1987, Coyle et al. 1986, Tsintzas etal. 1996, Christensen & Hansen 1939) and (iii) thatpre-exercise muscle glycogen supercompensation(carbohydrate-loading) (Hawley et al. 1997) or carbo-hydrate ingestion during exercise (Coyle et al. 1986),or both (Bosch et al. 1996), delays the onset of fatigueand improves exercise performance.\\nHowever, it must be remembered that relatively few\\ncarbohydrate-loading studies have been conductedwith an adequate placebo control group. It seemshighly improbable that neither athletes nor re-searchers are completely unaware of the widely re-ported beneﬁts of carbohydrate-loading and thatsuch knowledge is without effect on the ﬁndings of\\n134these trials. Indeed, two of the ﬁrst such trials whichincluded adequate placebo-controlled groups haveboth failed to ﬁnd any ergogenic effect of pre-exercisecarbohydrate loading (Burke et al. 1999, Hawley etal. 1997) under experimental conditions when suchan effect might have been expected.\\nThe ﬁnding that the reversal of hypoglycaemia\\nalone allows exercise performance to continue(Coggan & Coyle 1987, Christensen & Hansen 1939)proves conclusively that liver glycogen depletion isone form of energy (carbohydrate) depletion that candeﬁnitely limit exercise performance. Interestingly,the rapidity with which the reversal of hypoglycaemiarestores exercise performance indicates that a centralneural ‘‘governor’’ must be active, similar to that acti-vated during high intensity exercise at altitude. How-ever, this control would be activated by changes inblood glucose concentrations and would act to pre-vent continuing high rates of muscle contraction andblood glucose oxidation that would further reducethe blood glucose concentration, risking hypogly-caemic cerebral damage.\\nBut, in as much as no technique has yet been de-\\nvised that will instantly reverse muscle glycogen de-pletion, in the same way that intravenous glucose in-fusion or oral glucose ingestion rapidly reverses hy-poglycaemia, so it is impossible to prove conclusivelythat muscle glycogen depletion alone limits prolonged\\nexercise performance. It needs to be remembered thatthere are many physiological changes besides muscleglycogen depletion that develop during exercise, andthat any or all of these could contribute to, or causefatigue during prolonged exercise. In addition, rela-tively little attention has been paid to the possiblerole of central (neural) fatigue (Davis & Bailey 1997)asthefactor limiting prolonged exercise when muscle\\nglycogen concentrations are also very low. Futurestudies of the energy depletion model need to showthat central neural factors do not cause the fatiguecurrently ascribed to the development of muscle gly-cogen depletion during prolonged exercise.\\nThus, the belief that muscle glycogen depletion\\ncauses fatigue is an interesting hypothesis that is sup-ported logically by the ﬁndings that subjects who areexhausted during prolonged exercise develop very lowmuscle glycogen content (Fitts 1994, Bosch et al.1993, Tsintzas et al. 1996, Burke et al. 1999), and thatmuscle glycogen is the metabolic fuel required for sus-tained high intensity exercise (Bosch et al. 1993). Itwould seem logical to assume that the two are caus-ally linked at exhaustion during prolonged exercise;namely, that the near absence of muscle glycogen inexhausted subjects explains why they are unable tomaintain, let alone increase, their exercise intensity atexhaustion.

muscleglycogen depletion, strongly supports the theory(Hawley et al. 1997). However, the possibility thatpart or all of these ﬁndings could also result froma placebo effect, acting through the central nervoussystem, needs to be considered (Burke et al. 1999). Inaddition, it is unclear how the inability to produceATP at sufﬁciently high rates from one fuel sourcecan explain this form of fatigue, given that skeletalmuscle ATP concentrations remain high at exhaus-tion (as they do in all other forms of exhaustion(Fitts 1994)).\\nNevertheless, there is a body of evidence that con-\\nﬂicts with the predictions of this hypothesis. For ex-ample, the classic study of Coyle et al. (1986) showedthat athletes ingesting carbohydrate terminated exer-cise after 4 h when their muscle glycogen concen-trations and rates of carbohydrate oxidation were thesame as values measured 1 h earlier when the athleteswere not exhausted. Another study found that ath-letes who adapted to a high fat diet were able to exer-cise to signiﬁcantly lower muscle glycogen concen-trations at exhaustion than when they were carbo-hydrate adapted (Lambert et al. 1994).\\nConversely, Helge et al. (1996) showed that pre-\\nviously untrained subjects who trained on a high fatdiet for 7 weeks before switching to a high carbo-hydrate diet for one week increased their pre-exercisemuscle glycogen concentrations by 44% with only asmall further increase in performance between theseventh and eighth weeks of the trial. Furthermore,performance was still substantially worse in fat-adapted subjects than it was in subjects who trainedfor 8 weeks on a high carbohydrate diet and whosepre-exercise muscle glycogen concentrations were32% lower than fat-adapted athletes exposed to ahigh carbohydrate diet for one week.\\nIn addition, exercise performance evaluated on 3\\noccasions in both dietary groups terminated beforethere was marked muscle glycogen depletion. Theauthors concluded: ‘‘Factors other than carbohydrateavailability are responsible for the differences in en-durance time between the groups’’ (p. 303); and‘‘These observations also indicate that fatigue duringprolonged moderately intense exercise does not al-ways seem to be closely related to glycogen depletion,as is usually stated’’ (Christensen & Hansen 1939,Bergstrom et al. 1967). In his extensive review, Fitts(1994) similarly concludes: ‘‘It seems unlikely thatmuscle glycogen depletion, low blood glucose, andthe resultant decline in carbohydrate oxidation is anexclusive fatigue factor during prolonged exercise’’.He does, however, acknowledge that ‘‘a possibilityexists that muscle glycogen depletion is causative infatigue via a mechanism independent of its role inenergy production’’ (p. 83).\\n135In addition, to my knowledge, no study has yet es-\\ntablished that training improves endurance perform-ance exclusively by increasing body carbohydratestores and by delaying the onset of carbohydrate de-pletion during prolonged exercise in humans, al-though this ﬁnding has been reported in rats (Fitts etal. 1975) whose metabolism is substantially differentfrom that of humans.\\nSimilarly, it is currently difﬁcult to explain perform-\\nance in ultra-endurance events, especially the ﬁnal 42km running leg of the 226 km Ironman triathlonevents according to this model, which holds that exer-cise of moderately high intensity is not possible oncethere is marked muscle glycogen depletion. After cyc-ling at 40 km Áh\\n»1for 4.5 h, the lead cyclists would be\\nexpected to have near total muscle glycogen depletionaccording to data from laboratory studies (Bosch et al.1993). Y et the best performers in that event are able torun at close to 16 km Áh\\n»1for a further 160 min. This\\nprobably represents an exercise intensity of ±66% VO 2\\nmax. The studies of Rauch et al. (1998) and O’Brien\\net al. (1993) suggest that total carbohydrate oxidationduring very prolonged exercise of up to 6 h durationexceeds the estimated carbohydrate stores in liver andactive muscle by up to 100%. Either these calculationsare incorrect, or other sources of carbohydrate, in ad-dition to those in the active muscles and liver, mustcontribute to fuel oxidation in events lasting more than4–6 h. One possibility is that lactate oxidation of glyco-gen stored in the inactive skeletal muscles contributesa substantial additional amount to fuel use during veryprolonged exercise (Rauch et al. 1998). How increasedlactate oxidation contributes to performance is notknown.\\nSimilarly, provision of carbohydrate at high rates\\nintravenously (Coggan & Coyle 1987) cannot extendexercise performance indeﬁnitely. Whilst this couldsupport the argument that muscle glycogen is theim-\\nportant carbohydrate source limiting exercise per-formance, the alternate possibility is that anotherfactor, unrelated to depletion of body carbohydratestores, perhaps a rising body temperature discussedsubsequently, or central neural fatigue induced byother factors, may also limit endurance performance.\\nPerhaps there is a necessary rate of carbohydrate\\noxidation that is required to sustain a speciﬁc exerciseintensity and that progressive whole body carbo-hydrate depletion lowers that rate, inducing fatigue.If this is correct, then fatigue resistance during pro-longed exercise could be due to the capacity to sus-tain a higher rate of carbohydrate oxidation, andhence a higher respiratory quotient (RQ) during pro-\\nlonged exercise. Again, this model suffers from thepersisting logical impasse that a failure to generateATP sufﬁciently rapidly must cause exercise to ter-minate because of muscle ATP depletion and rigor, aphenomenon which does not occur (Fitts 1994).')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Bosch et al.

Laboratory simulation suggests that an elite cyclist cyc-\\nling 180 km in 4 h 30 min would cycle at an oxygen consump-tion of 57 ml/kg/min. Based on the measured contribution offat and carbohydrate oxidation to this energy requirement (col-umns on the left of the ﬁgure), this would require the oxidationof about 700 g of carbohydrate and 175 g of fat. This comparesto the predicted maximum body stores of 520 g of carbohydrateand 5000 g of fat in an elite triathlete. Hence this model predictsthat the elite triathlete must commence the running leg of thetriathlon with very low or absent whole body carbohydratestores.\\nAn equally plausible alternate theory postulates\\nthat superior endurance capacity may be determinedby the exact opposite; by a superior capacity to oxid-ize fat and hence maintain a lower RQ during pro-\\nlonged exercise. The latter possibility is supported byat least some evidence. In the studies of Bosch et al.(1993), those athletes unable to complete 3 h of exer-cise at 70% VO\\n2max after carbohydrate-loading had\\nsigniﬁcantly higher RQ during exercise and weretherefore characterized by an inability to sustain highrates of fat oxidation during prolonged exercise. In-deed, simulated metabolic balance studies for the 226km Hawaiian Ironman triathlon suggest it to be verylikely that the capacity to oxidize fat at high rates willinﬂuence running speed late in the race when calcu-lations suggest that muscle glycogen stores are likelyto be depleted.\\nFigure 8 shows the expected energy metabolism\\nduring 4.5 h cycling at an oxygen consumption of 57ml/kg/min. This is equivalent to cycling at 40 km/hand completing the 180 km cycle leg of the Ironmantriathlon in the time necessary to be amongst the raceleaders. The data for this simulation come from lab-oratory data measured on elite South African cyclists(I. Rodger. Unpublished data).\\nThe simulation predicts that after 4.5 h of cycling\\nan elite male Ironman triathlete would be expected tohave oxidized about 700 g of carbohydrate and 175 gof fat. This compares to predicted whole body carbo-hydrate and fat stores of 520 g and 5000 g, respec-tively. Hence this model predicts that, at the end ofthe cycle leg, an elite athlete would have depleted his\\n136body carbohydrate stores, yet must still run 42.2 kmat close to 16 km/h if he wishes to be successful.\\nOur other laboratory data suggest that after 4.5 h\\nof such exercise, the carbohydrate contribution towhole body energy metabolism would comprise ablood glucose oxidation rate of 1.2 g/min (21 kJ/min)and a lactate oxidation rate of 0.6 g/min (10.5 kJ/min). T ogether with the average maximum rate of fatoxidation that we have measured after 6 h of labora-tory cycling (0.76 g/min; 28 kJ/min), this provides atotal rate of energy production of 59.5 kJ/min. Thiswould provide energy at a rate sufﬁcient to sustain arunning speed of approximately 12 km/h, sufﬁcientto complete the 42 km marathon leg of the Ironmantriathlon i n3h3 0m i n (Fig. 9). T o equal the best\\nmarathon time yet run in that race, the athlete wouldbe required to oxidize fat at a rate of 1.15 g/min (Fig.10). This rate is approximately 50% faster than wehave measured in cyclists in our laboratory.\\nAccordingly, if this metabolic model of fatigue in\\nthe Ironman triathlon is correct, then the differencebetween running the ﬁnal marathon in 2 h 40 minversus 3 h 30 min may simply be a 51% (0.4 g/min)\\nFig. 9.

Laboratory studies suggest that after a 3.8 kmswim and a 180 km cycle, the athlete’s body carbohydrate storeswould be depleted so that energy for the running leg wouldcome from oxidation of (mainly ingested) blood glucose, bloodlactate and from circulating free fatty acids derived from muscleand adipose tissue triglyceride.

If these data for the maximum capacity to oxidizeglucose and lactate in the carbohydrate-depleted state are cor-rect, then to sustain the rate of energy expenditure necessary torun the marathon in 03:30:00, the carbohydrate-depleted tri-athlete must oxidize fat at a rate of 0.76 g/min.')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Ironman triathlete', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='crossover concept', type='Concept', properties={}), Node(id='muscle recruitment model', type='Concept', properties={}), Node(id='Brooks and Mercier', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='fuel choice crosses over', type='Idea', properties={}), Node(id='Noakes 1997, 1998', type='Literature', properties={}), Node(id='2 h 40 min', type='Duration', properties={}), Node(id='Ironman triathlon', type='Event', properties={}), Node(id='oxidize fat', type='Ability', properties={})], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='Ironman triathlon', type='Event', properties={}), target=Node(id='2 h 40 min', type='Duration', properties={}), type='HAS_RECORD_TIME', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Ironman triathlete', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='oxidize fat', type='Ability', properties={}), type='HAS_CAPACITY', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Brooks and Mercier', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='crossover concept', type='Concept', properties={}), type='DEVELOPED_CONCEPT', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Brooks and Mercier', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='fuel choice crosses over', type='Idea', properties={}), type='ARGUE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='muscle recruitment model', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='Noakes 1997, 1998', type='Literature', properties={}), type='DESCRIBED_IN', properties={})], source=Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 14, 'id': '3bae17dc803f36acdaa3f5c098a3cf87'}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nFig. 10.

If the maximumcapacity to oxidize glucose and lactate in the carbohydrate-de-pleted state is unchanged from values given in Fig. 9, then tosustain such a high rate of energy expenditure, the athlete mustoxidize fat at a rate of 1.15 g/min. This model predicts that thesuperior ability of the elite Ironman triathlete may result froma much greater (approximately 50%) capacity to oxidize fatthan has been measured in our laboratory experiments of veryprolonged laboratory exercise involving sub-elite athletes(Rauch et al. 1998).\\ngreater capacity to oxidize fat when body carbo-\\nhydrate and, especially, muscle glycogen stores aredepleted. Of course, this model does not negate therequirement that such high rates of fat oxidationcan only be achieved if the central nervous systemcontinues to recruit an appropriately large numberof muscle ﬁbres able to produce an appropriateforce.\\nIn summary, the human body has a limited ca-\\npacity to store carbohydrates. In addition, high ratesof carbohydrate oxidation are necessary to sustainhigh rates of energy expenditure (in the fed state).Furthermore, studies of very prolonged exercise (6 h)show that rates of carbohydrate oxidation remainhigh in athletes who ingest appropriate amounts ofcarbohydrate during exercise (Rauch et al. 1998). Asboth muscle and liver glycogen depletion occur in thefatigued state, it has popularly been assumed thatthere is a direct causal relationship between, espe-cially, muscle glycogen depletion and the develop-ment of fatigue during prolonged exercise. Y et someﬁndings suggest that this relationship may not bestrictly causal under all circumstances. In addition isthe logical impasse which requires that any energydepletion model predicts that exercise must terminatewhen muscle ATP depletion occurs, leading to musclerigor. In the absence of such evidence, it would seemthat factors in addition to depletion of body carbo-hydrate store may contribute to, or even cause, fa-tigue during prolonged exercise.\\n137At present, no study has conclusively established\\nthat training-induced changes in the capacity to storeand metabolize carbohydrate during prolonged exer-cise are causally related to training-induced changesin performance in humans, although this relationshipis frequently assumed. The alternate possibility isthat the capacity to oxidize fat at high rates whenbody carbohydrate stores are depleted, may delay fa-tigue and determine performance during exercise ofmoderately high intensity that lasts more than 4 hand is typiﬁed by ultradistance running and triathlonevents (Fig. 8–10).\\nIn this regard, the ‘‘crossover’’ concept of Brooks\\nand Mercier (1994) is of particular interest. Theseauthors argue that fuel choice during exercise‘‘crosses over’’ from predominantly fat to exclusivelycarbohydrate at exercise intensities above about 80%VO\\n2max. They conclude that training produces dif-\\nferent effects depending on the intensity of the exer-cise being evaluated. At exercise intensities belowtheir ‘‘crossover’’ point, training increases fat oxi-dation whereas at higher exercise intensities, trainingincreases the capacity to burn carbohydrates. Accord-ing to their concept, exercise at higher intensities(±70% VO\\n2max) would be limited as an example of\\nenergy supply limitations (an inability to sustain highrates of carbohydrate oxidation), whereas exercise atlower intensities would be limited by muscle glycogendepletion. In fact the models are identical – accordingto the energy (muscle glycogen) depletion model, fa-tigue results from an inability to supply ATP sufﬁ-ciently rapidly from fat oxidation (failure of energysupply from fat oxidation). The opposite pertainsduring high intensity exercise. In fact, as argued hereand elsewhere (Fitts 1994), both the energy supplyand the energy depletion models predict that muscleATP depletion limits exercise. This does not occur;hence, the models must be too simplistic to explainwhat has been found.\\nThe muscle recruitment (central fatigue)/muscle power\\nmodel\\nThe two previous models are based on the assump-\\ntion that it is either the delivery of substrate eitherin blood (oxygen) or via the glycolytic and oxidativepathways (ATP) that limits exercise performance. Thesteps of (il)logic that have inﬂuenced these assump-tions have been described (Noakes 1997, 1998). It re-mains difﬁcult to prove whether or not either of thesemodels is correct. Y et both continue to dominate, per-haps subconsciously, research and teaching in the ex-ercise sciences, often to the exclusion of competingpossibilities.\\nAn alternate view is that it is not the

recruitment of\\nskeletal muscle forms the basis for the ‘‘central (ner-vous system) fatigue’’ hypothesis (Davis & Bailey1997). This model holds that the brain concentrationof serotonin (and perhaps other neurotransmitters,including dopamine and acetylcholine) alters the den-sity of the neural impulses reaching the exercisingmuscles, thereby inﬂuencing the rate at which fatiguedevelops, especially during exercise. Alternatively,there may be inhibitory reﬂexes arising from the exer-cising muscles and which feedback to the spinal cord,reducing skeletal muscle recruitment at the level ofthea-motoneuron. The evidence for both mechan-\\nisms has been extensively reviewed (Davis & Bailey1997).\\nIn brief, a number of studies indicate that manipu-\\nlation of central nervous system neurotransmitterconcentrations, in particular increasing dopamineand reducing serotonin concentrations, can enhanceexercise performance whereas the opposite impairsperformance. In addition, there is direct evidence forreduced central neural drive to muscle after fatiguingmuscle contractions (Behm & St-Pierre 1997, Bakeret al. 1993, Newham et al. 1991). This evidence issufﬁciently persuasive to believe that central nervoussystem fatigue contributes to fatigue during pro-longed exercise lasting tens of minutes to hours.\\nThe clear evidence that fatigue at high altitude is\\ncaused by reduced central nervous system recruit-ment of the exercising muscles has been described. Itis very likely that the fatigue that occurs during exer-cise in the heat is also likely limited by a failure ofcentral recruitment as this form of fatigue cannot beexplained by any other model. Thus, there is nowsubstantive evidence that each athlete can store onlysome limiting amount of heat before being forced toreduce the exercise intensity or alternatively cease ex-ercising altogether (Nielsen et al. 1990, 1993, 1997).There is no evidence from these studies that exhaus-tion under these conditions is associated with eitherskeletal muscle ‘‘anaerobiosis’’ or energy depletion.Rather, that it is either the total heat accumulated orits rate of accumulation that limits exercise is con-ﬁrmed by intervention studies which show that pre-cooling improves performance (Nielsen et al. 1997,Booth et al. 1997) whereas pre-heating has the op-posite effect (Gongalez-Alonso et al. 1999).\\nIn summary, there is sufﬁcient evidence to suggest\\nthat a reduced central nervous system recruitment ofthe active muscles terminates maximum exercise athigh altitudes (and probably also at sea level). Thesame mechanism likely terminates exercise in the heatwhen the body temperature reaches some limitingmaximum and also when hypoglycaemia develops. Inall these examples, reduced central recruitment of\\n138muscle would function to prevent organ damage(Noakes 1997).\\nHowever, the contrasting ﬁnding that skeletal\\nmuscle recruitment, measured as skeletal muscle elec-tromyographic activity, rises during exercise at thesame workload (Takaishi et al. 1994), is usually inter-preted as evidence for a progressive failure of muscleﬁbre contractile function requiring additional ﬁbrerecruitment if the required force is to be sustained.Thus, this model holds that there is a progressive pe-ripheral fatigue for which the central nervous systemmakes an appropriate adjustment.\\nY et these studies usually impose a constant work-\\nload on the subject for the duration of the activity.But competitive sport does not usually involve suchconstant workrates; workrates tend to vary in arandom, stochastic way (Palmer et al. 1994). W efound that during prolonged exercise, which in-cludes bouts of self-chosen high intensity exercisedesigned to simulate stochastic exercise, there is aprogressive reduction in power output during thebouts of high intensity exercise (Burke et al. 1999).This strongly suggests central fatigue in which, dur-ing bouts of exercise requiring a near maximum ef-fort, there is an inadequate increase in central neu-ral drive to compensate for the expected reductionin the power output of the fatiguing skeletal muscleﬁbres (peripheral fatigue). That a relatively smallpercentage of the available muscle mass is ever re-cruited, even during maximal exercise (Sloniger etal. 1997), remains a perplexing but relatively under-recognized enigma. Proponents of any model of pe-ripheral limitations for exercise performance needto explain why the body does not recruit all itsavailable muscle mass to produce the necessaryforce under varying exercise conditions as so-called‘‘peripheral fatigue’’ develops.\\nIn summary, one interpretation of the muscle re-\\ncruitment (central fatigue) model is that changes incentral neurotransmitters induce fatigue simply as anatural consequence of prolonged exercise andchanges in the relative balance of the different (ergo-genic and ergolytic) neurotransmitters in the brain.No speciﬁc physiological value or importance is as-signed to this phenomenon.\\nAlternatively, I have argued that a reduced central\\nactivation of the exercising muscles may be necessaryto protect the human under speciﬁc conditions(Noakes 1997, 1998). It is postulated that these con-trol mechanisms are necessary (i) to prevent myocar-dial ischaemia during exercise at high intensity; (ii) toprevent the development of muscle ATP depletionand muscle rigor during high intensity exercise; (iii)to prevent myocardial ischaemia or cerebral hypoxiaduring exercise at altitude; (iv) to prevent a fall inblood pressure during exercise in patients withchronic heart failure; (v) to prevent heatstroke during')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='study on skeletal muscle contractility', type='Publication', properties={}), Node(id='finding on environmental heat load and track race performance', type='Publication', properties={}), Node(id='Cardiovascular/Neural Model', type='Concept', properties={}), Node(id='study on heat production and fatigue', type='Publication', properties={}), Node(id='finding on small size advantage during running', type='Publication', properties={}), Node(id='finding on environmental heat load and marathon performance', type='Publication', properties={}), Node(id='Noakes 1992', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='exercise performance', type='Concept', properties={}), Node(id='McCann & Adams 1997', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='superior athletic performance', type='Concept', properties={}), Node(id='enhanced exercise performance', type='Concept', properties={}), Node(id='Widrick et al. 1996', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Costill et al. 1992', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Nielsen et al. 1993, 1997', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='statement explaining swimming performance', type='Publication', properties={}), Node(id='Dennis & Noakes 1999', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Muscle power model', type='Concept', properties={}), Node(id='Fitts et al. 1989', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Biomechanical model', type='Concept', properties={})], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='Muscle power model', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='superior athletic performance', type='Concept', properties={}), type='EXPLAINS', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Costill et al. 1992', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='statement explaining swimming performance', type='Publication', properties={}), type='AUTHORED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Fitts et al. 1989', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='study on skeletal muscle contractility', type='Publication', properties={}), type='AUTHORED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Widrick et al. 1996', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='study on skeletal muscle contractility', type='Publication', properties={}), type='AUTHORED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Biomechanical model', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='enhanced exercise performance', type='Concept', properties={}), type='EXPLAINS', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Dennis & Noakes 1999', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='finding on small size advantage during running', type='Publication', properties={}), type='AUTHORED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Nielsen et al. 1993, 1997', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='study on heat production and fatigue', type='Publication', properties={}), type='AUTHORED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Cardiovascular/Neural Model', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='exercise performance', type='Concept', properties={}), type='LIMITS', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Noakes 1992', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='finding on environmental heat load and marathon performance', type='Publication', properties={}), type='AUTHORED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='McCann & Adams 1997', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='finding on environmental heat load and track race performance', type='Publication', properties={}), type='AUTHORED', properties={})], source=Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 16, 'id': '286c4336b04d972419f3dcb3455ff22d'}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nprolonged exercise in the heat, and (vi) to prevent glu-\\ncopaenic brain damage during prolonged exercisewhen hypoglycaemia results from liver glycogen de-pletion. The likely mechanism of control is throughthe regulation either of skeletal muscle recruitment orof excitation/contraction coupling in the muscle.\\nMuscle power model\\nThis model holds that muscle contractile capacity,that is the ability of individual muscle cross-bridgesto generate force, is not the same in the muscles ofall humans, so that those with superior athletic abil-ity have muscles with a superior capacity to generateforce (superior contractility) by the individual cross-bridges of the different muscle ﬁbres. This model iswell accepted by cardiac physiologists, the majorityof whom would argue that calcium delivery to themyoﬁbres and the activity of the enzyme involved inATP hydrolysis, myosin ATPase, rather than sub-strate supply, determine the contractile state of themyocardium in both health and disease (Opie 1998).\\nI could ﬁnd only one recent statement using this\\nmodel to explain superior athletic performance,speciﬁcally in swimming: ‘‘First, the strength of themuscles used in swimming is a major determinant ofsuccess in events from 50 m to 1500 m. Though thismay not seem surprising, it must be remembered thatstrength per se does not dictate fast swimming. The\\nforces generated by the muscle must be effectively ap-plied to the water if they are to propel the body. Thus,strength speciﬁcity is the key to swimming success’’(Costill et al. 1992).\\nThere are rather few studies of the contractility of\\nskeletal muscle isolated from athletes. These studiesgenerally show that endurance training reduces skel-etal muscle contractility (Fitts et al. 1989, Widrick etal. 1996). This establishes that skeletal muscle con-tractility is not an immutable characteristic of the dif-ferent muscle ﬁbre types (Fitss & Widrick 1996). Byextension, one might speculate that the contractilityof the speciﬁc muscle ﬁbre types might differ betweenathletes of different abilities in different sportingdisciplines, compatible with this muscle power model.\\nIn summary, these two models of exercise perform-\\nance predict that changes in exercise performancemay result from increased skeletal muscle recruitmentresulting from enhanced central neural drive, or fromincreased muscle contractile function resulting frombiochemical adaptations in muscle that increaseeither force production or the rate of sarcomereshortening, or both.\\nHowever, the increase in performance resulting\\nfrom these adaptations would occur only to the ex-tent that the cardiovascular limits for exercise per-formance were not exceeded, according to the Car-diovascular/Neural Model.\\n139The biomechanical model\\nThere is growing interest in the role of muscles as\\nelastic energy return systems which function both assprings and torque producers during exercise (Pennisi1997, Roberts et al. 1997). Central to this model isthe prediction that the greater the muscle’s capacityto act as a spring, the less torque it must produce andhence the more efﬁcient it is. The more efﬁcient, moreelastic muscle will enhance exercise performance,especially in weight-bearing activities, by slowing (i)the rate of accumulation of those metabolites thatmay cause fatigue during exercise, and (ii) the rate ofrise of body temperature, thereby delaying theachievement of the core temperature that prevents thecontinuation of exercise.\\nThis new information underscores another import-\\nant logical weakness of the cardiovascular/anaerobicmodel for explaining enhanced endurance perform-ance. For that model predicts that superior perform-ance during prolonged exercise results from an in-\\ncreased oxygen delivery to muscle and an increased\\nrate of energy and hence heat production. Thus, ac-cording to that model, the price of running faster isthat more heat must be produced. But a higher rateof heat production would induce fatigue prematurelydue to excessive heat accumulation, according to theﬁndings of Nielsen and colleagues (Nielsen et al.1993, 1997). A more logical biological adaptationwould be to reduce the rate of oxygen consumption\\nand hence the rate of heat production by increasingthe athlete’s efﬁciency (economy) of movement.\\nIndeed, if the rate of heat accumulation limits exer-\\ncise performance under speciﬁc conditions, then fac-tors that slow the rate at which heat accumulateswhen running fast should enhance performance. T wosuch factors are small size (Dennis & Noakes 1999)and superior running economy. A smaller size reducesthe amount of heat produced when running at anyspeed. When environmental conditions limit the ca-pacity for heat loss, smaller runners will be favoured(Dennis & Noakes 1999).\\nFurther evidence supporting this argument that\\nheat accumulation is a factor limiting endurance per-formance, is the ﬁnding that race times in both themarathon (Noakes 1992) and the longer distancetrack races including the 3000 m steeplechase and the10 000 m (McCann & Adams 1997) deteriorate as theenvironmental heat load increases. Thus, there is aninverse relationship between the environmental heatload, measured as the W et Bulb Globe T emperatureIndex, and the reduction in race performance.\\nTherefore, according to this model, the more econ-\\nomical the athlete, the faster he or she will be able torun before reaching a limiting body temperature.

Indeed, most training studies\\nshow that improvements in running economy are per-haps the most likely response to training, especiallyin those who are already well-trained (Svedenhag &Sjodin 1985). This adaptation allows the athlete torun faster at the same oxygen consumption; thus, heor she completes a given distance more rapidly forthe same average rate of heat accumulation but a re-duced overall heat expenditure. This would be advan-tageous under conditions in which the heat load onthe athlete increases (during the day).\\nFigure 11 shows that this adaptation may indeed\\nexist. In a cross-sectional study of recreational (notelite) ultramarathon runners, it was found that thosewho trained more were more economical and hencecould run faster at the same oxygen consumption or %VO\\n2max. During competition, the better trained\\nathletes ran at the same or a slightly lower % VO 2max\\nbut completed the races in a shorter time (Scrimgeouret al. 1986). Hence being more economical, not havinga higher VO\\n2max, appears to be a more logical tech-\\nnique to enhance endurance performance.\\nIn contrast, a high aerobic capacity, often a marker\\nof poor running economy (Noakes 1988, 1992),would likely cause more rapid rates of heat accumu-lation and hence the more rapid onset of fatigue dur-ing prolonged exercise. This ﬁnding alone could ex-plain why the best marathon runners usually haveVO\\n2max values in the range of 63–74 ml/kg/min.\\nLess economical runners with higher VO 2max values\\n(Noakes 1988) have not necessarily been more suc-cessful (Noakes et al. 1990, Noakes 1992).\\nThus, this model predicts that success in endurance\\nFig. 11.

A more likely adaptation\\nwould be to reduce the athlete’s size and increase hisor her running efﬁciency. That runners believe theyrun better when lighter, is well known.\\nAnother African analogy for this prediction is pro-\\nvided by the physiological strategy that the cheetahhas evolved to survive as a successful predator. Thecheetah, whose chase is terminated by an elevatedrectal temperature after running at up to 100 km Áh\\n»1\\nfor less than a minute (Taylor & Rowntree 1973), suc-\\nceeds because of the animal’s small size and probablya high degree of running economy (due to elasticityprovided by the ﬂexible spine). Thus, laboratory ex-periments showed that when the cheetah’s rectal tem-perature reached 40.5–41 ¾C, ‘‘the cheetahs refused to\\nrun ... They would simply turn over with their feet inthe air and slide on the tread(mill) surface’’ (Taylor &Rowntree 1973).\\nThe small size of the cheetah and its likely high\\nrunning economy slows its rate of heat accumulationjust sufﬁciently for it to outrun the smaller gazelles(·25 kg) on which it preys and whose escape is also\\nrestrained by a rising body temperature (Taylor & Ly-man 1972). Thus the chase between the gazelle andthe cheetah is probably decided by which individualanimal accumulates heat more slowly during thechase. In contrast, the heavier, more muscular lionhas evolved a different co-operative, hunting strategy,targeting larger but slower mammals.\\nPerhaps the point is that smallness and greater run-\\nning economy would seem to be a technique used toincrease endurance capacity in one animal, the chee-tah. Logic suggests that this technique may also beapplicable to elite human athletes.\\nA second component of the biomechanical models\\nstems from the accumulating evidence that repeatedhigh velocity, short duration eccentric muscle con-tractions, as occur during running, induce a speciﬁcform of fatigue that develops during running racesand is measurable for at least 7 days after a marathonrace (Komi & Nicol 1998; Nicol et al. 1991).\\nCharacteristics of this fatigue are a failure of the\\ncontractile capacity of the exercised muscles with areduced tolerance to muscle stretch and a delayedtransfer from muscle stretch to muscle shortening inthe stretch/shortening cycle.

Thus any evaluation of fa-tigue resistance, especially in weight-bearing activitieslike running, needs to consider this speciﬁc form ofstretch/shortening cycle fatigue.\\nT o return to the African analogy, empirical obser-\\nvation of the running stride and the anatomical struc-ture of the lower limb of Kenyan runners suggests, atleast to this author, that an evaluation of the elasticelements of the legs of elite Kenyan runners and theirresistance to stretch/shortening cycle fatigue wouldlikely be very rewarding.\\nFor example, it appears that African athletes gen-\\nerally train harder than do Caucasian runners (Tans-er 1997, Coetzer et al. 1993). Especially the trainingvolumes and intensities of the Kenyan runners (Tans-er 1997) are unmatched by other athletes. But toachieve such training volumes, there must be superiorresistance to the stretch/shortening cycle damage pro-posed by Komi & Nicol (1998), both in training andin marathon racing.\\nHence, another possibility is that the more elastic\\nmuscles of elite distance runners are better able toresist eccentrically induced damage in training. Thismay allow more intensive daily training and hencesuperior adaptations to training.

(1991) show that there is apersistent reduction in peak torque and endurance performancetime of the quadriceps muscle of subjects after they completeda 42.2 km marathon race. Integrated electromyographic activity(IEMG) in both the vastus medialis (VM) and the vastus lat-eralis (VL) was also reduced after the marathon. These studiesshow that there is a long-term effect of marathon running onskeletal muscle performance that persists after the muscle’s en-ergy stores are replaced, indicating that this abnormality is notexplained by the Energy Depletion Model. It seems probablethat the marathon ‘‘wall’’ (Noakes 1992) is probably explainedby these alterations in skeletal muscle function.\\nhypothesis (Davis & Bailey1997). But it conﬂicts with\\none proposal of the muscle recruitment model, whichholds that exercise performance is regulated at a sub-conscious level and which exists, in part, to preventconscious override that might damage the human.\\nIt would seem that exercise performance must in-\\nclude at least some component that can be inﬂuencedby conscious effort. The dichotomy of physiologyand psychology has generally prevented adequate lab-oratory evaluation of this model. Any studies show-ing an ergogenic effect of any placebo interventionon exercise performance would prove that this modelcontributes, in part, to athletic performance. Any de-tailed discussion of this model is beyond the scope ofthis author’s expertise.\\nSummary\\nThis paper has reviewed some of the models currently\\npromoted to describe how exercise performance islimited by fatigue and enhanced by training. The ar-gument advanced here is that until the factors deter-mining both fatigue and athletic performance are es-tablished more deﬁnitely, it remains difﬁcult to deﬁnewhich training adaptations are the most importantfor enhancing exercise performance, or how training')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Foundation for Research and Development', type='Organization', properties={}), Node(id='Liberty Life Insurance Company', type='Company', properties={}), Node(id='University of Cape Town', type='Institution', properties={}), Node(id='Founding Donors of the Sports Science Institute of South Africa', type='Organization', properties={}), Node(id='Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='research article', type='Publication', properties={}), Node(id='Medical Research Council of South Africa', type='Organization', properties={}), Node(id='Bromor Foods', type='Company', properties={}), Node(id='variety of nutritional and pharmaceutical companies', type='Organizations', properties={})], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='research article', type='Publication', properties={}), type='AUTHORED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='University of Cape Town', type='Institution', properties={}), target=Node(id='Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), type='FUNDED_RESEARCH', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Medical Research Council of South Africa', type='Organization', properties={}), target=Node(id='Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), type='FUNDED_RESEARCH', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Liberty Life Insurance Company', type='Company', properties={}), target=Node(id='Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), type='FUNDED_RESEARCH', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Foundation for Research and Development', type='Organization', properties={}), target=Node(id='Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), type='FUNDED_RESEARCH', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Founding Donors of the Sports Science Institute of South Africa', type='Organization', properties={}), target=Node(id='Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), type='FUNDED_RESEARCH', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Bromor Foods', type='Company', properties={}), target=Node(id='Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), type='FUNDED_RESEARCH', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='variety of nutritional and pharmaceutical companies', type='Organizations', properties={}), target=Node(id='Noakes', type='Person', properties={}), type='FUNDED_RESEARCH', properties={})], source=Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 19, 'id': '0933052b647e58e940d916cc36341ce7'}, page_content='Noakes\\nshould be structured to maximize those adaptations.\\nThis remains a serious weakness for the practical ap-plication of much research in the exercise sciences.\\nHowever, within the constraints provided by these\\nmodels, it would seem that the following training ad-aptations would contribute to enhanced exercise per-formance with training.(a)Cardiovascular/neural recruitment model : Rel-\\nevant training adaptations would be those thatresult in an increased VO\\n2max and skeletal\\nmuscle blood ﬂow during both maximal and pro-longed submaximal exercise.\\nAccording to the model I have presented here,\\na plateau in coronary ﬂow would appear to bethe factor that limits the cardiac output, andhence the VO\\n2max. Thus, an essential compo-\\nnent of training would be to increase the maximalcoronary ﬂow.\\nHowever, even if the maximal coronary blood\\nﬂow limits the maximal cardiac output, the actualpeak workrate or peak VO\\n2max that is achieved\\nwill depend on the contractile state of the myo-cardium and the efﬁciency with which the heartis able to convert that maximum coronary ﬂowinto a peak cardiac output. Similarly, the actualmaximum work of which the muscles are capableat the VO\\n2max, will equally depend on the econ-\\nomy and contractility of the skeletal muscles.Thus, optimum training would not only maxim-ize coronary ﬂow but also the efﬁciency and con-tractility of both the heart and skeletal muscles.\\nIncidentally, according to this model, inter-\\nventions such as EPO therapy, blood re-infusion,or the administration of oxygen, all of which im-prove performance, would act in part by increas-ing oxygenation of the myocardium at maximalexercise, thereby allowing a greater cardiac outputand hence a higher VO\\n2max.\\n(b)Energy supply model : The important training ad-\\naptation would be an increased capacity to storeand utilize metabolic substrates during exercisewith a greater capacity to produce ATP and pre-vent a reduction in muscle phosphagen concen-trations under all exercise conditions. Adap-tations in different metabolic pathways would benecessary for optimizing performance in activi-ties of different durations and intensities.\\n(c)Energy depletion model : A reduced rate of carbo-\\nhydrate utilization during prolonged exercisewould enhance performance by delaying the on-set of whole body carbohydrate depletion. Thismodel predicts that an increased capacity to burnfat during prolonged exercise would enhance en-durance performance. That this model can also\\n142be considered as an ‘‘energy supply’’ model wasdescribed above.\\n(d)Muscle recruitment and muscle power models :\\nThese models predict that increased skeletalmuscle contractile function, a peripheral effect,or increased neural recruitment, a central nervoussystem effect, would be advantageous for per-formance during exercise.\\n(e)The biomechanical model : A key predictor of the\\nbiomechanical model is that increased movementeconomy would improve performance by reduc-ing the rate of heat accumulation during exercise.This model also explains why a reduced bodymass would improve performance during pro-longed exercise as it slows the rate of heat ac-cumulation.\\nThe importance of elastic return energy, espe-\\ncially in weight-bearing sports, and the identiﬁ-cation of stretch/shortening cycle fatigue suggeststhat training may improve elasticity and delaystretch/shortening cycle fatigue, perhaps by al-tering the elastic component of skeletal muscle,tendons and ligaments.\\nConclusion\\nThe importance of these conceptual models is that they\\nindicate that different physiological systems may de-termine performance under different exercise con-ditions. Hence, exercise physiologists need to considerall these models when they design studies to determinewhich are the most important physiological, biochem-ical, neural and other factors determining the changesin exercise performance that result from training.\\nMore importantly, this review shows that many\\nﬁndings are incompatible with the predictions of oneor more of these models. Rather than simply continu-ing to accept these inconsistencies uncritically, themodern generation of exercise physiologists shouldchallenge old dogmas and so approach more closelythe unattainable truth (Noakes 1997, 1998).\\nKey words: fatigue; VO\\n2max; heart; skeletal muscle;\\nglycogen; fat metabolism; muscle recruitment; con-tractility.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe author’s research is funded by the dedicated ﬁnancial sup-\\nport of the University of Cape T own, the Medical ResearchCouncil of South Africa, the Liberty Life Insurance Company,the Foundation for Research and Development, the FoundingDonors of the Sports Science Institute of South Africa, BromorFoods, and a variety of nutritional and pharmaceutical com-panies.')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Adam', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='accessible offline', type='Characteristic', properties={}), Node(id='lightweight app', type='Characteristic', properties={}), Node(id='Best Talent', type='Award', properties={}), Node(id='Microsoft Word', type='Product', properties={}), Node(id='Microsoft', type='Company', properties={})], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='Adam', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Microsoft', type='Company', properties={}), type='WORKS_FOR', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Adam', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Best Talent', type='Award', properties={}), type='HAS_AWARD', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Microsoft Word', type='Product', properties={}), target=Node(id='Microsoft', type='Company', properties={}), type='PRODUCED_BY', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Microsoft Word', type='Product', properties={}), target=Node(id='lightweight app', type='Characteristic', properties={}), type='HAS_CHARACTERISTIC', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Microsoft Word', type='Product', properties={}), target=Node(id='accessible offline', type='Characteristic', properties={}), type='HAS_CHARACTERISTIC', properties={})], source=Document(metadata={'source': '/home/cht/workspace/GraphRag/exercise fatigue_KB/Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance.pdf', 'page': 20, 'id': 'ac13997caee1852b4d8dd22f3142d574'}, page_content='Physiological models to study exercise\\nReferences\\nAcevedo EO, Goldfarb AH.
