Exercise fatigue is the result of multiple factors working together. In addition to basic physiological, psychological, and environmental factors, it is also influenced by the type of exercise, duration, level of recovery, and other aspects.

Type of Exercise: Different types of exercise affect fatigue differently. For example, aerobic exercise (such as long-distance running, swimming) often leads to endurance fatigue, primarily related to cardiovascular function and glycogen depletion; while anaerobic exercise (such as sprinting, weightlifting) is more likely to cause muscle soreness and lactate accumulation. High-intensity interval training (HIIT), due to its frequent bursts of power, can lead to acute fatigue and requires a longer recovery period. The diversity of exercise types determines the various loads on the body, which affects the manifestation and difficulty of recovery from fatigue.

Duration of Exercise: The duration of exercise has a significant impact on the level of fatigue. Long-duration exercise gradually depletes energy reserves (such as glycogen) and leads to more noticeable loss of fluids and electrolytes. Short-duration high-intensity exercise, on the other hand, may cause rapid muscle fatigue and a decline in neuromuscular responses. Thus, the length of the exercise determines the demand for energy reserves and the endurance of the body to fatigue.

Level of Recovery: Recovery is essential to alleviate exercise fatigue and includes sleep quality, nutritional replenishment, active relaxation (like stretching, low-intensity exercise), and passive relaxation (such as massage, cold compresses). Good recovery can promptly replenish energy (like glycogen and protein), eliminate metabolic waste (like lactate), and allow the muscles and nervous system to repair. Insufficient or low-quality recovery may lead to cumulative fatigue or even chronic fatigue syndrome, adversely affecting subsequent performance.

Training Level: An individual's training background and adaptation level determine their tolerance to fatigue. Well-trained athletes generally have higher cardiovascular endurance, muscle endurance, and neuromuscular control, making them more resistant to fatigue and enabling faster recovery. In contrast, those lacking training or with irregular exercise habits are more likely to experience fatigue and require longer recovery time when performing the same intensity of exercise.

Psychological Factors and Motivation: Psychological state plays a crucial role in the perception of fatigue. A positive mental state, strong exercise motivation, and good self-regulation can lessen the subjective feeling of fatigue and enhance performance. Conversely, mental stress, anxiety, and lack of motivation can heighten the perception of fatigue, causing it to appear early during exercise.

Environmental Factors: External environmental conditions significantly impact exercise fatigue. For example, high temperatures and high humidity increase the difficulty of body heat dissipation, accelerate dehydration, and cause heart rate to rise, increasing metabolic load, which leads to quicker fatigue. In high-altitude environments with low oxygen, due to insufficient oxygen supply, the body tires more easily, and exercise performance declines. Suitable environments with moderate temperatures and fresh air help reduce fatigue, improving exercise efficiency.

In summary, exercise fatigue is influenced by factors such as exercise type, duration, level of recovery, training background, psychological state, and environmental conditions. Effectively managing these factors, such as arranging exercise types and intensities reasonably, ensuring adequate recovery, enhancing training levels, maintaining a positive mental state, and choosing appropriate environments, can significantly delay the onset of fatigue, improving performance and enjoyment of exercise.
